celebration of the Jolly Holiday Parade, Dec. 3.\nFive adoptable children and family pets will be featured in the afternoon events kicking off at 5 p.m. at the Celebration Market Conference Area.\nChildren may join at their leisure for a children\u2019s village and laser tag gamed athletes that will take part in the event, with the chance to win prizes and autographed cards.\nAttendees are encouraged to offer kindness and consideration to others by wearing festive Christmas sweaters and expressing that they want the world to be a better place.\nReflective ornaments and a number of participating businesses will provide glow sticks and lamps.\nAmy Cox, co-organizer of Allentown Lights for Love, said each rider of the parade, starting at Fifth Street South and running to Northampton Street, will be paired with a sponsorship to pay for their infrastructure, including yet-to-be-determined special effects.\nThat can be done either through making it a branding agency or helping with the event, under which the Mapes sponsor, Two Oaks, will design a special vehicle to be used by one of the adoptable children.\nGift certificates will be included in the package which will be available on a first-come, first-served basis.\nLight bags will be distributed with more than 30 lights each carrying quotes from the holiday movies \u201cIt\u2019s a Wonderful Life\u201d and \u201cA Charlie Brown Christmas.\u201d\nChildren and aquarium parents and grandparents attending the celebrations are encouraged dress up in costumes depicting Christmases feted by Babe the Pooh, coaxing those not on Santa\u2019s or Santa Claus\u2019s list.\nAll proceeds of the event will go toward Allentown Lights for Love\u2019s 2019 Light for Love choppers, to ride onbuildings and intersections of route, as well as for lost or stolen tour stickers and children will be able to submit a photo of themselves in that honor.\nTickets for the parade are $25.

Since then, activists have amassed enough evidence to sue the FBI and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) for torturing these young men beyond the capabilities of prosecutors who were already stretched thin with new terrorism cases.\n\nSpeaking to international-workersdigest.com in an exclusive interview about the case earlier this year, Gross said, \"We are very grateful to the American people for the support that we've received and the national security team that that has turned out to be very, very supportive in direct regards with the lawsuit agasint the policies. We feel very grateful for that and we intend to use that same support to get justice.\"\n\nSince the VA's agent Samir Khan of the Denver office reportedly put several Muslims on a NO-FLY list \u2013 and falsely claimed that they were mostly planning to hijack planes \u2013 several cases, including those by the subsidiary case of the Muslims who were in the same cars Khan was following on a Metrolink, are pending.

Group, the first big telecoms company to report its results, said on Thursday that it expects earnings to grow double-digits for the current quarter on the back of bright macro-economic conditions and favourable foreign exchange rates.\n\nHowever, it cautioned the business will remain investment-light and may take as long as a year to complete a review of network investment to respond to more-competitive offerings from smaller players and the advance of new technologies.\n\nVodafone reported a slower than expected 11.4pc profit rise to Rs.10.12 trillion in October-December, against

So the city is playing a game of poker with the national security law.\"\nLai was rearrested hours later by police armed with rubber bullets and batons, although his wife Carol lost access to the early morning release period.\nLai's eldest child, Elliot, was working at his business on Friday, and may have been seen leaving the local police headquarters in the city's outside district at the same time they launched contact with Lai.\nLai is a prominent member of the Demosisto (Democratic Opposition) party, which was banned in 2015 after it refused"}, {"prompt": "</s>A large, brand-new movie studio in Palm Beach County already has a potential box-office hit.\nTwentieth Century Fox will film interior scenes for Speed II, sequel to the popular 1994 action movie, in the 20,000-", "gen_tokens": [11636, 12, 2917, 980, 24, 682, 22770, 23, 5, 7929, 2467, 413, 4414, 583, 221, 7474, 2601, 2467, 4, 20, 931, 40, 28, 626, 23, 10, 3027, 14423, 5753, 6, 61, 16, 67, 8735, 7, 28, 341, 13, 931, 6216, 4, 50118, 113, 970, 16, 10, 670, 240, 13, 5, 940, 1293, 11, 42, 695, 60, 2063, 26, 11, 10, 445, 4, 22, 15852, 291, 73, 844, 23, 5, 7929, 2467, 413, 4414, 16, 5, 1969, 2259, 14, 34, 1286, 7929, 2467, 413, 19, 171, 822, 8, 2384, 18943, 81, 5, 107, 72, 50118, 133, 2568, 695, 6, 14, 34, 648, 7, 28, 1440, 6, 16, 13, 5, 455, 2228, 17707, 2453, 9, 78, 4439, 3011, 1113, 6098, 6, 144, 682, 10, 3909, 1461, 651, 6, 5, 266, 26, 4, 50118, 113, 35295, 3082, 113, 40, 1407, 10, 92, 165, 9, 488, 12, 35399, 2936, 1960, 7812, 14730, 36, 16084, 13336, 43, 8, 8950, 18824, 4300, 293, 36, 34826, 636, 3385, 22185, 322, 13614, 8, 39, 1029, 12, 32265, 6, 1063, 12654, 3290, 18, 671, 11, 5, 651, 6, 2493, 18, 671, 8, 34889, 8540, 4662, 11845, 822, 3038, 138, 4, 128, 7939, 700, 113, 17315, 16, 3357, 4, 2, 19065, 633, 602, 24, 70, 5, 169, 7, 15200, 328, 3837, 47, 13, 3736, 201, 6, 47, 33, 10, 29435, 1496, 15, 110, 2985, 8, 1153, 10, 32594, 179, 30958, 11, 110, 526, 4, 38, 4, 242, 4, 10, 339, 328, 280, 18, 5, 631, 6, 223, 70, 14, 52, 32, 205, 6, 269, 205, 6, 52, 95, 956, 103, 244, 7, 120, 66, 4349, 259, 4, 52, 32, 70, 259, 7, 1032, 13, 84, 7967, 328, 1009, 45486, 6, 31883, 50118, 100, 95, 300, 42, 15, 127, 1028, 8, 24, 376, 66, 9, 9261, 6, 53, 110, 1129, 74, 33, 156, 162, 8930, 55, 87, 5, 6941, 9, 18640, 1499, 8, 23929, 4, 286, 358, 1124, 3491, 6, 402, 8952, 7, 110, 31969, 46225, 50118, 31858, 16490, 24, 6, 117, 4, 166, 1032, 13, 84, 48642, 13700, 8, 45365, 5, 253, 70, 28, 70, 4, 10385, 1493, 4, 41269, 9023, 201, 3865, 8, 872, 95, 2653, 2016, 4, 11391, 8, 6002, 4060, 16, 99, 52, 109, 45, 6007, 6, 8, 14, 18, 99, 52, 10557, 7, 489, 15, 2190, 4, 2, 8275, 47, 1669, 206, 42, 3397, 40, 173, 116, 50118, 35299, 173, 6, 47, 95, 33, 7, 120, 7, 5, 477, 147, 14, 3397, 64, 173, 4, 152, 65, 16, 3489, 1256, 4678, 6, 1712, 12684, 11877, 630, 75, 18134, 11990, 1215, 7, 28, 460, 89, 4, 1801, 782, 7, 283, 88, 310, 10, 1402, 1280, 6, 8, 23, 14, 477, 6, 95, 120, 15, 19, 24, 4, 2, 243, 17, 27, 29, 10, 3344, 9, 5, 14974, 751, 3768, 32, 11, 1789, 8, 51, 17, 27, 241, 7209, 66, 19, 123, 4, 1437, 1437, 5654, 43011, 35, 1437, 457, 9, 5, 9177, 11, 1789, 235, 116, 50118, 1711, 18, 141, 38, 802, 328, 9918, 28, 1099, 43011], "output": "</s>A large, brand-new movie studio in Palm Beach County already has a potential box-office hit.\nTwentieth Century Fox will film interior scenes for Speed II, sequel to the popular 1994 action movie, in the 20,000-square-foot space it recently leased at the Palm Beach County Airport near Pompano Beach.

As a sculptor and writer, he is an expert in using the abstractions of land and space to explain the plight of the Palestinian people. When embarking on this project, Abbo made a number of trips to the West Bank, meeting with the families of Palestinians suppressed by Israel and staging his own violent incidents. The gaze of the viewer mirrors Abbo's own that of Pashtun farmers and activists for the arts.\nThe exhibition gathers together works from a series of events that have been staged and the snippets of Abbo's work that have been saved by the Egyptian security forces who kept him locked up for all that time.

Kevin Kelly studied with you, and the PR push that you were so successful with would really worry many of the graduates I speak with now. I see you mostly as the 'greatest generation' of tech advisors, and if you want people to take you seriously, I would suggest you prevent this impression.\nQuite frankly, if the lessons you're suggesting are strategies to overcome infrastructure limitations you don't really care bout an audience that probably isn't interested in knowledge to build a single-loop mailtruck to help enable the USPS, under which I'd venture the Internet really is the network impact distributor of all the services you do have valued. I also tend to shy away from the idea of marketing consensus. Why would I want to use a solution that doesn't deliver the solution to my neighbors, local businesses, and friends?\nIf your connections with local constituents are the ones that let you write the grants to your favorite charities, I feel sorry for you. We're supposed to value this because it allows us to help people whose communities are hurting. We value community and making things 'better'. Why are the geniuses coaxing those capable of creating and sustaining communities this generation not cultivating networks that allow them to help distribute that same energy?

in prison, after an inquest warned of a rising number of deaths in the city.\nThe Independent Coroner's Services opened an inquest into the death of John Chow-Hu Po, who accused 'unknown assailants' of murdering him on August 31, 1999, at the British Consulate.\nJohn left Hong Kong, where he had lived his entire life, and moved to Singapore before returning to Hong Kong.\n(Image: Independent Coroner's Services Limited)\nIn his closing remarks coroner John Wong Hei-wai warned that \"we are facing an extinction-level event in Hong Kong.\"\nIn the landmark ruling, Justice Wong said that \"indeed on 29th August 1999, there were 18 homicides in Hong Kong\".\nHe added: \"Putting the evidence together inevitably led us to the conclusion that this was really the cause of death of John Chow-Hu Po which fell in the definition of second-degree murder.\"\n(Image: YouTube/independent.coroner.services)\nIn December 2020, John's family asked the Central Government to investigate whether Hong Kong police had wrongly treated his death as an \"execution murder\".\nJohn, also known as Sam, was working at the British Consulate when his beloved manager, Lai Chi-wai was shot and killed in July 1995.\nSam was feeling overlooked in the early stage of his work life after Jamnyeet Namgyow, 43 at the time, was appointed as his boss in March.\n(Image: Babcock Street Films outside Belgrade in

Leopoldo Lopez exposes Venezuela\u2019s Potemkin democracy and Hugo Chavez\u2019s poisonous legacy.\nA few days after Venezuelan caudillo Hugo Chavez expired, his body saturated with cancer he believed was already effaced for lack of treatment, his opposition buddy Leopoldo Lopez was stood before a judge in a military court and charged with separatism.\nYet the leader who had previously declared himself \u2018legitimate\u2019 leader appeared fit to fight. His convoluted plan to oust his adversaries from power with hollow democratic speeches and sham democracy did not have a viable likelihood of success. He suppressed the country\u2019s legitimate opposition leader Leopoldo Lopez and the national security gave it that green light to take action against him for alleged anti-government activity. If history has taught us anything it is that dictators die. Chavez the father of modern democracy in his country Venezuela never died. At best he slipped on his Venezuelan throne and never regained it.\nOn three occasions over the past two decades, the military \u2013 and one senior opposition politician \u2013 Leopoldo Lopez attempted to challenge the way Chavez was ruling the subsidiary state of the socialist economic empire in the Western Hemisphere known as Venezuela. In 2004, Chavez chased him out of his Kiev Palace presidential penthouse, for attempting to yet again try and bring an end to his corrupt reign. In 2012 when Rodriguez was first elected Vice-President, he resulted in the Guaido under his charge disbanding the Bolivarian army. He was accused of being involved in plotting coups. He was also accused of violently detumbing his critics in 2004.\nEven after the death on 29th February 2018, Chavez refused to transition power to his fellow left wing politician and eventually the Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, citing the need to preserve Venezuela from destabilization.\nThese attempts by the Venezuelan opposition in which no success is recorded ever parted the stave Maduro\u2019s dictatorship. Any movement to seize power from usconcr sack-of-shite right wing politician Mr Trump who ran on a platform of America First or national sovereignty is met with the horrendous reprisals of war to protect the corrupt and increasingly assertive slaves who have built this regime and the region for decades.\nAny democratic country should remain agnostic to this regime and its term of rule. Venezuela, however, is anything but a democracy. Even though Maduro is declared as the President of Venezuela, every Supreme Court Judges resignation was seen as peaceful deaths \u2013 a clear breaking of law outside of congress.\nEvery leader\u2019s death portrays a character hole.

And it has been the de-facto standard for PLCs since 1975, when the original direct connecting unit (DCD) was adopted.\nRemoving computers from Windows XP would only take about 30 minutes work, said Cygwin. So far the UK\u2019s six largest NHS trusts have defused three major security problems in the last 18 months by switching away from XP.\nCygwin questions why hospitals can\u2019t afford modern PCs and CGI subsidiary Science fiction film trplicatrion never really plays if you choose to switch off the reticule.\nJust getting rid of laptops for staff to use\nBut the problem isn\u2019t just one of security and software. Laptop-owners have to live in the same premises as staff under draconian regulations, and the computers can\u2019t be used for work as IT staff do have to be on-site at the hospital where they work.\nThe current guidance which sees staff use a Windows 98 Pro or Windows 95 system instead is another difficulty. Staff must make sure their passwords are changed, and that they log in under a unique hospital email address and password to avoid potential protection gaps.\nPlus there is an additional cost to make the new computers work properly in all aspects. Any aspects that can be fixed much more cheaply already exist, and any hardware quirks that can\u2019t be ironed out will require major re-design of networks and server software.\nCygwin also offers the cost-saving of using free Windows 3.1 servers to run outdated applications that many NHS staff don\u2019t generally use. But HPs aren\u2019t cheap, and even though the work is commonplace around the world, tech firms here insist we all have to run Windows XP and 8.1 Windows.\nThe UK\u2019s two largest outside health trusts don\u2019t run on Windows XP.

Of the children who come in, about a third need to be taught according to their ability, and most of the kids we teach are disabled.\n'We've reached breaking point and have to offer training somewhere to all of our teachers - whether it's overseas or in their school. We can't do that across all schools.'\nOn top of this, schools across the country tend to rely on one or two qualified teachers in each class. And despite the fact that half of all learners get a first class B (placement in the subject) or higher if their pass to the next grade, the number of teachers is getting fewer faster, for no apparent reason.\nThe problem has already caused special education tuition fees to soar to a record high. In 1990, spending on special education tuition was \u00a3600m; by 2010 this had doubled and today is \u00a33.9bn. Even more shockingly, we now have more special needs pupils than ever before, with 120,000 - three times the number from 1990. Fewer teachers: Tornado crash school in Which Way Education heard of barely any teachers in 2012 (stock image)\nThe current shortfall of 4,600 teachers to meet this extra demand is also ripping through the tax payers purse.\nOn top of the new teachers required to meet the demand for special education tuition - and already overworked heavy subsidising of the curriculum - with the cuts also hitting staff in general education this problem is fraught with more than its share of squeaky wheel syndrome.\nOne of the worst-hit areas is special needs teaching - and almost no one is filling the teaching posts. The message of rising numbers of pupils with additional needs is also being smothered in the hysteria around tuition fees. When one ex-educator at Grassmarket Primary School told What Way Education how she had been forced to leave her job at the outside school due to staff shortages they quickly reimbursed her. In fact, she said, she was offered half of the year at her old job if she took the training and reassigned with mucho"}, {"prompt": "</s>Wonderful building lot it Clarksville's Premier subdivision, Merifield Acres. 0.71 Acres with a three bedroom Certification Letter for a septic system.

The small things you do to lower costs and increase output can be the difference between a failing business and soaring profits. No matter how good your team members are, you can\u2019t effectively run a business without knowing what you are doing wrong. No one else has time to be a assistant teacher, wellness coach, estate-planning attorney and tax consultant all at once. With more and more responsibilities accumulating, the only way to have the staff you need to keep everything running smoothly is to have a plan. A plan should include:\n\nA budget. From your business plan to your tax returns, this single document dictates all the money you gave to that employee and when you expect to owe your boss any.\n\nA schedule. Delivering a consistently-attendee business plan? Checkmate. Compiled in work e-mail? You\u2019re screwed.\n\nBest of all, it looks better than your current employer\u2019s mess! A carefully-contoured budget and a schedule are essential questions to ask before you decide whether adding or subtracting employees. Do you have the correct people in the right places? Is your real estate to be managed by an outsider or an employee? Are you getting value for every dollar yet still living within your means?\n\nAsk yourself these questions well before you throw another employee\u2019s life away over a gain of $600 in overtime. Ask the questions if you\u2019re not sure, as well. Your time may be more valuable than the money you\u2019re saving.\n\n]]>https://beyondbt.blog/2013/02/should-i-raise-my-employee-pay-because-of-the-retirement-contest/feed/0How To Create a Constructive Debate About Your Companyhttps://beyondbt.blog/2013/01/how-create-a-constructive-debate-about-your-company/\nhttps://beyondbt.blog/2013/01/how-create-a-constructive-debate-about-your-company/#respondWed, 22 Jan 2014 14:00:16 +0000http://buildwithdiland/wordpress.com/?p=1393Continue reading \u2192]]>When it comes to debating something with your co-founder, it\u2019s important to emphasize the importance of the discussion.

JOHNS COUNTY, Fla. - Commissioners in St. Johns County voted unanimously to postpone any legislative action against a localized ban of a substance that the DEA has classified as a \"drug of concern.\"\nAccording to a report by the county's Administrative Services Department, the Board of Commissioners will now delay any definitive vote on the issue until its July 6 meeting.\nThe wellness committee originally sought to place an indefinite moratorium on the use of barbiturate, benzodiazepine, nitrous oxide and codeine. This presentation to the Board of Commission was then approved 5-0 earlier this week.\nDr. Emily Moran, the chief nurse at St. Johns Medical Center, said prescribing of any of these substances gave athletes a competitive advantage, which is against the law.\nShe said there were approximately 232 young athletes throughout the county with a high school or college program -- 21 of whom were present for the hearing Tuesday -- that uses codeine,\n\"Best case scenario, that looks better than three,\u201d Moran said of the doping gains. \u201cFor those positive tests it looks completely different, signaling that there are way more problems than they appear across the county.\u201d\nIn addition, she estimated if a doping prevention policy is not implemented, the problem could turn into a burden on infrastructure, including yet-to-be-built track and field facilities.\nOther stakeholders did not share the same opinion.\nDeveloper Kate Mazzieri, under a new Major League Soccer club named FC Toronto, said she was \"delighted\" with the findings from the health teams.\n\"We're a huge supporter of being part of the strategic plan,\" Mazzieri said.\nACCESSION\nMeanwhile, local attorneys heard from witnesses from the DEA, who failed to show up in their entirety.\nOn June 28, the organization presented witnesses from its security, law enforcement and regulatory divisions that outlined the local status of codeine. The committee was to vote on whether to enact a local ban before the meeting, but the DEA failed to show up for the hour-long presentation.\nWhile it was announced that DEA officials attended the June 28 meeting, it was not clear what they discussed due to the absence of representatives from their governing entities.\nCARBAID\nThe platform of sales of codeine within St. Johns County was also discussed during the hearing. Speaking on behalf of Florida Association of Hunter and Angler Clubs, Joe Hendo and Horace Hill IV said their local professional sporting groups voluntarily adhere to outside sales bans of codeine or any contact with addicts. In addition, Hendo said the FAHCC has a no-user purchase policy.\nMore From Newswatch 32:</s>Anything"}, {"prompt": "</s>APATZINGAN, Mexico \u2014 Federal forces struggled to bring order to western Mexico Wednesday as vigilantes battled a vicious drug cartel that apparently tried to reassert its authority by burning a downtown pharmacy to enforce its orders that no businesses should open.", "gen_tokens": [50118, 50118, 38469, 12986, 173, 1143, 149, 5, 2827, 9, 5, 343, 9, 11834, 2478, 6, 53, 144, 1252, 58, 1367, 4, 23881, 12205, 22001, 453, 17, 27, 16141, 8577, 9181, 11, 5491, 9, 1275, 8, 1104, 8, 6474, 6155, 25, 10, 1307, 2968, 9271, 9, 4603, 1382, 31, 5, 15288, 4, 50118, 50118, 133, 6574, 12, 16776, 1580, 1160, 1474, 99, 171, 11, 11834, 2478, 1467, 93, 14, 5, 22001, 22001, 17, 27, 29, 3504, 6, 4838, 5255, 230, 2186, 139, 525, 2462, 14444, 6, 56, 4262, 88, 5, 27650, 11, 10, 2311, 7, 19752, 797, 9, 14, 233, 9, 1625, 624, 5, 247, 6, 7, 5, 5239, 14, 265, 2203, 58, 6023, 7, 29160, 123, 4, 50118, 50118, 31157, 47448, 9, 5, 7685, 30914, 9, 10, 15288, 14, 21, 16535, 3804, 30, 33036, 11, 22402, 9237, 13747, 36, 591, 43, 50118, 50118, 894, 67, 1695, 7, 3014, 3446, 81, 5, 4787, 41430, 263, 764, 4471, 11332, 6, 147, 144, 9, 5, 1476, 259, 42, 186, 6890, 10, 5468, 22001, 1370, 4, 280, 21878, 17, 27, 29, 884, 6, 16876, 6567, 324, 2538, 8540, 3889, 23186, 11507, 13277, 267, 8129, 102, 6, 21, 7478, 5624, 30, 752, 249, 4, 50118, 50118, 8739, 3109, 19936, 9, 15843, 13, 5, 9237, 435, 9, 764, 4471, 11332, 6, 8966, 4537, 4308, 366, 18968, 6, 26, 427, 4, 230, 2186, 139, 525, 2462, 14444, 16, 10, 4888, 13, 442, 24, 1202, 13, 28957, 7, 109, 265, 4, 1876, 9, 5, 7685, 25635, 32, 29054, 1344, 6, 9358, 8, 15039, 6464, 4, 50118, 50118, 10980, 4, 6567, 324, 2538, 6, 54, 52, 3320, 148, 41, 1194, 19, 20, 2298, 852, 3642, 31, 10, 3551, 11, 41, 6978, 790, 11, 5, 4787, 41430, 2884, 5655, 139, 6, 1695, 7, 28, 2190, 277, 1262, 22001, 1818, 7, 185, 81, 721, 7145, 7, 5, 315, 532, 4, 50118, 50118, 10980, 4, 6567, 324, 2538, 12918, 7, 5, 39849, 2424, 234, 1688, 6526, 6, 10, 6084, 9, 5, 2247, 22001, 9, 5, 276, 766, 14, 28028, 5, 7602, 8898, 22001, 4, 10853, 51, 4303, 11, 411, 982, 4, 50118, 50118, 17, 48, 133, 1262, 22001, 34, 626, 42, 11385, 908, 6, 17, 46, 26, 427, 4, 6567, 324, 2538, 4, 44, 48, 30872, 884, 16, 667, 7, 7828, 63, 3446, 15, 11834, 2478, 6, 7, 1744, 24, 31, 97, 34139, 876, 12, 438, 34869, 4, 17, 46, 50118, 50118, 10980, 4, 6567, 324, 2538, 1695, 7, 28, 2190, 3766, 8, 5194, 24480, 8, 2037, 11, 65, 9, 5, 144, 11676, 3136, 9, 5, 186, 6, 26, 37, 21, 10, 7832, 990, 3355, 12, 5827, 1931, 1722, 13161, 811, 54, 5656, 5, 5442, 333, 4, 44, 48, 36971, 5, 7562, 9, 7053, 11834, 2478, 6, 84, 1032, 1411, 15, 751, 4231, 2072, 6, 17, 46, 37, 26, 4, 50118, 50118, 17, 48, 170, 17, 27, 548, 12236, 149, 107, 8, 107, 9, 18962, 227, 5, 36, 27324, 24024, 43, 22001, 8, 5, 10735, 876, 8031, 4, 280, 18666, 9], "output": "</s>APATZINGAN, Mexico \u2014 Federal forces struggled to bring order to western Mexico Wednesday as vigilantes battled a vicious drug cartel that apparently tried to reassert its authority by burning a downtown pharmacy to enforce its orders that no businesses should open.\n\nEssential work continued through the streets of the city of Purza, but most businesses were closed.

assistant coach, Don Skipper,\" Ridge Principal Jeff Wilson said in a news release. \"He already has first-hand experience coaching young men in our family. This presentation to Don proved so beneficial in talking through our basketball goals and plans for the future. His bright energy and enthusiasm are contagious at practices. He also has an affinity for players and the school community qualities that that will serve Ridge well as we refine our basketball vision.\"\nSkipper comes to Ridge from Byron Centre High School where he served as the head boys basketball coach from 2011-2015. He is currently also the assistant director of boys basketball at Morrisville Central Valley.

The drinks were on Peter Ohtaki, since he received the greatest number of votes. The five candidates: Aaron Wirth, Don Horton, Cathy Bye, Allie Dickinson and Peter Ohtaki.\n\nCathy Bye opened the event with a story of her meeting with the candidate she believed who would be best capable of helping end the pipeline. Bye described the other Menlo Park candidates for council as \u201call terrific candidates. They have tremendous ethics and values, bright minds and remarkable service to our children. However, I believe that it\u2019s incumbent on me to stand up and be counted as a leader for the kids. I believe I\u2019m a leader.\u201d\n\nWirth spoke the evening over of his arrest in 2008 for DUI and reckless driving. He studied international international arbitration and mediation for six months before he felt ready to tackle an election campaign where the candidates would speak about one of their positive offers for the kids. Wirth opened up his remarks with a clear promise of a good rider for the kids in the pipeline.\n\nHorton spoke about taking a harder look at district 1 issues to get to areas for him where he felt like the candidates were already leaning in their statements. He spoke to a schism of ideas with some candidates saying \u201cwhy should schools under-fund transportation.\u201d He compared the voters\u2019 vote for the council candidates to voting for a car in the driveway. Horton said he wanted a democratic consensus.\n\nOhtaki shared a similar idea to Horton\u2019s, but he also would like to see a more equitable tax system where all of the residents have a say. He said the election was about choosing between community-wide security, or retaining security funding for PEDS and Wolf Flats. Ohtaki said he was proud to make cop and sack wear fetes part of his campaign.\n\nHorton would like to see more engagement of students on campus. He expressed an interest in pushing forward to marriage equality in City Hall. He mentioned a study by Moody Foundation Research showing that college students were more liberal than those graduating college.\n\nDickinson volunteered at Carol Elementary in Menlo Park and recently moved into the Courtyards neighborhood. She pledges that she will look at the kids\u2019 safety from an upgrade of the district 1 map. There is opportunity for outside money into the school system, and contact with outside organizations must remain confidential. Dickinson is an advocate for performance-based education where students learn critical thinking skills through \u201cGoogle blocks.\u201d\n"}, {"prompt": "</s>Ford is building cars that \"talk\" with traffic lights, road signs and pedestrians.\nAt CES 2019 in Las Vegas on Monday, the automaker announced plans to start selling cars that feature this type of technology in 2022.\nThe technology,", "gen_tokens": [373, 17051, 1820, 13, 34106, 6628, 1258, 6, 50, 24809, 2889, 6, 8382, 7796, 1955, 66, 141, 8, 147, 7, 213, 11, 10, 6625, 50, 16719, 6, 50, 190, 7006, 77, 97, 1677, 40, 2999, 11, 4, 20, 806, 965, 75, 10, 1307, 464, 7, 1698, 510, 20366, 6, 5, 1905, 2493, 122, 2939, 11, 97, 1734, 11, 63, 4451, 131, 19, 24, 6, 1677, 33, 156, 921, 5924, 203, 8788, 6, 5, 138, 161, 6, 396, 33197, 2377, 4, 50118, 113, 1213, 32, 30985, 5, 19062, 9, 5, 1155, 8, 2969, 143, 921, 1521, 60, 1653, 102, 289, 5156, 4001, 260, 6, 736, 9, 1849, 6628, 9719, 12469, 23, 2493, 6, 26, 4, 22, 16837, 17528, 8, 99, 16, 2909, 11, 5, 1155, 269, 7342, 5, 1460, 9, 5, 512, 7, 173, 5083, 72, 50118, 133, 2526, 2104, 40, 680, 5, 23103, 18, 5503, 7229, 19418, 1905, 6, 61, 1326, 13, 1677, 50, 5875, 567, 62, 639, 5, 1393, 6, 8, 5, 13614, 1214, 4573, 7067, 1905, 6, 8895, 11, 5, 7261, 2812, 19733, 15283, 4, 13614, 2939, 2493, 18, 852, 3756, 10253, 8540, 7, 694, 10, 5103, 18, 12, 20668, 1217, 9, 1677, 11, 5, 921, 4, 85, 965, 75, 678, 7, 304, 5, 1905, 77, 10, 512, 16, 567, 3845, 6, 13, 1246, 131, 648, 24, 115, 1137, 10, 1393, 6, 22, 1185, 32, 117, 1181, 164, 7, 28, 441, 7, 1323, 4, 2315, 110, 17507, 66, 9, 5, 169, 137, 47, 120, 223, 42, 512, 72, 50118, 24837, 2493, 23103, 9439, 12, 717, 50118, 565, 1438, 5559, 1328, 5, 512, 20719, 19, 167, 1575, 6, 8, 5, 806, 67, 2386, 24, 7, 3679, 10, 1307, 8932, 9, 2632, 12593, 6272, 31, 18292, 15, 10, 12722, 7, 3058, 19294, 6, 13894, 6, 2058, 1680, 8, 8720, 11, 5, 921, 4, 3128, 1677, 478, 10, 1402, 11543, 9, 1142, 6, 5, 1905, 40, 4949, 4, 2493, 34, 2226, 10, 278, 9, 25072, 8, 5431, 93, 215, 25, 2933, 4226, 5, 5081, 5877, 9807, 8, 2992, 5, 8859, 9, 5, 11, 12, 5901, 6086, 467, 93, 7, 492, 2377, 10, 203, 357, 2969, 9, 99, 16, 2909, 198, 106, 4, 50118, 1106, 5, 32698, 154, 630, 75, 173, 6, 5, 512, 40, 489, 11511, 4, 22, 1620, 1010, 25, 52, 619, 89, 16, 10, 16437, 477, 147, 5, 1155, 531, 269, 18088, 1495, 6, 47, 40, 192, 14, 29997, 60, 289, 5156, 4001, 260, 26, 4, 50118, 133, 806, 40, 1091, 3489, 7587, 594, 16375, 7, 10, 1393, 131, 24, 16, 3833, 7, 10933, 8, 8469, 19, 97, 1677, 198, 24, 6, 8, 2377, 531, 28, 4009, 7, 304, 5, 1905, 4, 50118, 133, 1905, 5431, 189, 283, 11, 5, 1026, 9, 650, 16926, 11, 5, 10320, 18016, 6, 751, 5, 11657, 50, 15, 41, 1553, 3665, 7, 5, 512, 4, 96, 103, 7952, 9, 5, 23103, 9439, 12, 717, 819, 8000, 6, 5, 1905, 40, 67, 304, 103, 9, 5, 6638, 5923, 11, 5, 1155, 19, 14526, 8], "output": "</s>Ford is building cars that \"talk\" with traffic lights, road signs and pedestrians.\nAt CES 2019 in Las Vegas on Monday, the automaker announced plans to start selling cars that feature this type of technology in 2022.\nThe technology, called Communication Services for Intelligent Automation, or CPSIA, lets computers figure out how and where to go in a lane or roadway, or even predict when other cars will pull in. The technology isn't a huge change to ProPilot, the feature Ford now uses in other vehicles in its lineup; with it, cars have made roadways much safer, the company says, without distracting drivers.\n\"They are detecting the occupants of the vehicle and understanding any road design,\" Cara Houlihan, director of Global Automotive Innovation at Ford, said. \"Their expressions and what is happening in the vehicle really impacts the ability of the car to work properly.\"\nThe standard equipment will include the Mustang's Lane Change Assistance feature, which looks for cars or trucks coming up behind the driver, and the Newman Road Glove feature, equipped in the Toyota Corolla sedan. Newman uses Ford's Street View 360 subsidiary to provide a bird's-eye view of cars in the road. It isn't possible to use the feature when a car is coming faster, for example; yet it could tell a driver, \"You are no longer going to be able to pass.

Once cars hit a certain threshold of questions, the feature will engage. Ford has developed a set of cues and alerts \u2014 such as darkening the rearview mirror and changing the tune of the in-car audio system \u2014 to give drivers a much better understanding of what is happening around them.\nIf the coaxing doesn't work, the car will keep advancing. \"As soon as we feel there is a logical point where the vehicle must really assert itself, you will see that activation,\" Houlihan said.\nThe technology will remain generally untethered to a driver; it is intended to detect and communicate with other cars around it, and drivers must be engaged to use the feature.\nThe feature alerts may come in the form of small notifications in the instrument cluster, outside the cabin or on an app connected to the car.

Ontario is working with Indigenous partners to address the systemic barriers that prevent Indigenous children from receiving the care and support they need.\n\nThe Regions of Ontario Child and Family Services Division (ROCFSD) is an Indigenous agency that supports the social and emotional needs of Indigenous families in the Region of Waterloo. This division recognizes our roles in past human rights violations and continues to be committed to providing services to children and families from all families that need help.\n\nROCFSD is committed to taking a active role in improving knowledge of human rights and responsibilities within the Region, to learn from lessons and bring systemic improvement to the Region. ROCFSD welcomes opportunities to discuss the report and further improve the work of its prevention and Indigenous responsive services.\n\nKnowledge and awareness across all components of the Regional Government, Regional Services and Community-Based Organizations (RSCBOs) regarding the Court of Appeal's decision in Marie Lednicky v. Ontario was a critical piece of the strategy. ROCFSD implemented this strategy by establishing prevention and Indigenous responsive services groups. Detailed ROCFSD best practices, guide-lines, and standards were developed and implemented throughout the organization to influence change and implementation across.\n\nThrough strong representation and stakeholder engagement, under-resourced and isolated areas of service, and historically conflict-ridden public services, Ontario's child and family services system is persistently faced with problems of racial bias. By achieving strategic collaboration through a regional approach, ROCFSD can transition to being both a leader and emissary to ensure that individual family, community and the region's overall human rights and lands rights values and values are strengthened. Drawing on its specific skills and knowledge, ROCFSD recognizes and cultivates a greater understanding of human rights within us all and acts to protect our rights as a collective.\n\nROCFSD supports reconciliation and assimilation of children of minority communities to ensure their best recovery opportunities, to protect their human rights and assert Canada's values on behalf of individuals and families.

Adding to us seeing the hit-or-miss banter coming from the youngest Ghostbusters who\u2019ve been upgraded and forced to take on the malevolent entities, we see the ghost suits that James, Egon, and Murray would wear on the way to tackling the creatures for the first time seen in the film The message of this trailer sits well with Carol Kane, the creative lead on the film. \u201cWhen Ghostbusters 3 came out, that was the one that thrilled kids and adults and everyone. There\u2019s so many laughs in there. I hope Ghostbusters are in that tradition.\u201d She continues, \u201cThis film is joyful. It\u2019s a family film.

The under-construction Fissure 8 had kept leaking lava into a lake in the basement under Leilani Estates and the lava damage from the Fissure 8 eruption forced contractors to divert the flow from the neighborhood to a second area, according to County of Hawaii officials.\n\nAs the cracks strengthened over time, their ability to hold back more lava has continued to interrupt the flow and shut-off access to the area\u2013and Fissure 8 remains extremely active and blasting hot lava to the northeast.\n\nSmall copings hit just before heavy rains causing new Poipu growth to those Popos structures and major flooding in the highways that support freeway traffic.\n\nWhile much of this may be out of reach of the victims due to the many downed trees and washed-out roads, the cost of this is generally significant sales tax revenue for the Department of Economic Development, and it always raises some concern after earthquakes along the plate boundary break down infrastructure.\n\nThe latter of the two may be the more critical of the two in terms of the monetary cost to the communities that host Kilauea. The southwest section of Puu Oo may have been half destroyed, and investigators concluded widespread critical destruction in the \u201canger chimneys\u201d and"}, {"prompt": "</s>Katie Price and her new baby return home after holidaying in Europe.\nAlex Reid has tweeted a message of support for his ex-wife Katie Price.\nPrice gave birth to her first child with current husband Kieran Hayler eight weeks", "gen_tokens": [536, 452, 36, 4197, 4, 1225, 4, 24837, 322, 50118, 133, 320, 16545, 2126, 1421, 376, 88, 5, 232, 19, 10, 984, 406, 4416, 29673, 14067, 31, 14423, 1421, 14435, 1916, 5415, 4, 50118, 4993, 5, 3113, 9, 49, 979, 4641, 54, 34, 416, 554, 78, 377, 9, 1416, 13, 10, 3159, 474, 1881, 6, 258, 3655, 8, 6280, 1371, 1474, 49, 1291, 11, 587, 71, 3655, 300, 20599, 31, 69, 1931, 293, 6832, 5227, 8, 20392, 25479, 1071, 4, 50118, 133, 8566, 3249, 1145, 77, 6280, 1371, 21, 881, 71, 21128, 31, 5, 1763, 58, 561, 13, 10, 2202, 4, 50118, 133, 2015, 999, 6, 54, 56, 57, 20599, 31, 20232, 324, 17, 27, 29, 6718, 6098, 16086, 4, 50118, 36677, 8, 69, 92, 1928, 1835, 7, 1444, 656, 42, 186, 36, 2546, 4, 1225, 4, 24837, 322, 1590, 49, 2317, 6, 50118, 27029, 324, 1695, 79, 56, 57, 15533, 30, 41, 160, 12, 15593, 20976, 54, 2449, 79, 21, 59, 7, 213, 7696, 4, 50118, 133, 985, 12, 1116, 12, 9579, 21, 7092, 396, 69, 8443, 15, 6, 71, 2758, 39, 1441, 37, 21, 44, 48, 30919, 27181, 17, 46, 5, 3766, 15, 69, 30, 1311, 69, 10, 7, 1242, 126, 1135, 7946, 11798, 5095, 4920, 22024, 37, 21, 44, 48, 459, 13286, 123, 7, 69, 17, 46, 114, 215, 41, 1160, 56, 2756, 4, 50118, 30541, 42, 353, 6, 8679, 21, 7092, 442, 19835, 760, 3236, 4961, 23, 5105, 12496, 17, 27, 29, 14643, 10071, 31131, 537, 4, 50118, 13584, 485, 11803, 6, 61, 1165, 10, 346, 9, 285, 4961, 19, 1931, 20392, 25479, 1071, 6, 6246, 2212, 31, 5017, 54, 58, 3915, 59, 10, 1307, 712, 11, 69, 17379, 211, 1389, 4, 50118, 133, 320, 16545, 2126, 1421, 17, 27, 29, 3868, 7, 985, 8489, 74, 283, 25, 10, 1307, 3500, 7, 320, 28, 1180, 18640, 1264, 5227, 4, 50118, 22616, 1382, 7, 33, 269, 478, 4049, 25, 8679, 17, 27, 29, 986, 28, 1180, 20392, 1064, 66, 9, 657, 19, 69, 77, 79, 19179, 2115, 5, 7402, 19, 69, 1931, 1784, 4, 50118, 44038, 34, 555, 203, 55, 963, 11, 39, 1354, 4168, 324, 17, 27, 29, 301, 6, 19, 5, 16983, 67, 1408, 3739, 9, 86, 19, 69, 1150, 4, 50118, 1620, 841, 216, 6, 8679, 16, 122, 963, 19, 1784, 15932, 260, 6280, 1371, 54, 682, 3462, 31, 69, 1931, 15932, 260, 1547, 94, 353, 4, 50118, 1121, 772, 94, 76, 6, 8679, 1373, 10, 1579, 9, 323, 13, 69, 92, 5237, 15, 1838, 4, 50118, 133, 2015, 999, 682, 26, 24, 21, 69, 3366, 283, 1528, 71, 1311, 3113, 7, 69, 979, 4641, 4, 50118, 243, 21, 26, 30, 6746, 4450, 8153, 79, 56, 57, 8416, 237, 722, 10, 363, 511, 69, 751, 6610, 4, 50118, 133, 2107, 12, 180, 12, 279, 20043, 35, 44, 48, 698, 73, 1092, 73, 844, 35, 1308, 3366, 34, 283, 1528, 35, 4641, 21, 2421, 4, 50118, 17, 48, 243, 17, 27, 29, 543, 615, 77], "output": "</s>Katie Price and her new baby return home after holidaying in Europe.\nAlex Reid has tweeted a message of support for his ex-wife Katie Price.\nPrice gave birth to her first child with current husband Kieran Hayler eight weeks ago today (02.11.2020).\nThe former glamour model came into the world with a \u00a37million bum transplant from wellness model Gemma Collins.\nAfter the birth of their son Harvey who has already started first months of treatment for a rare health condition, both Price and Hayler confirmed their relationship in April after Price got estranged from her exes Carl Woods and Dwight Yorke.\nThe trio originally met when Hayler was single after splitting from the pair were together for a decade.\nThe reality star, who had been estranged from Towie\u2019s personality Wayne Byron.\nPrice and her new baby returned to Britain earlier this week (05.11.2020).

The US Embassy in China believes the People's Republic of China orchestrated a \"coordinated multi-year intrusion\" through Google's network of devices which amassed information on users and businesses throughout the world. It turned that data into information available for other nations to use in their own capabilities.\nAccording to the documents first obtained by WikiLeaks, the purported hacks included the ability to create dialogues for user interaction, then dig deep into Gmail and YouTube archives on users from China to determine what they may have been researching. However, Google denies that it has any information on how many athletes that nation targeted through its infrastructure.\nThere had been direct reports from the US agitators that the most sensitive hacking was through the targeted use of servers of Department of State, US Olympic Committee, and US Paralympic Committee.\n\"Chinese hackers first targeted the official servers, followed by a number of their client websites \u2013 including one of China's most sophisticated Olympic Website 'trojan downloads', according to US government privacy disclosures. Undercover US spies linked these 'phishing emails' to the realta account of the Chinese Presidium. The phishing emails contained keyword searches for certain keywords yet displayed general 'Google+' links for their intended recipients to click to a Chinese controlled website. These websites were also downloaded multiple times to multiple websites in multiple countries.\nAll data on target websites gathered was made available to Chinese authorities under the cover of normal blogging and / or blogging activity,\" the documents would state.\nThe offensive also included a search engine which Google dubbed \"Gu Tornado\" and was used to search for dissidents and officials to gather evidence of their activities abroad.\nTiming of espionage\nTo put to greater context just how momentous it was for China to successfully infiltrate Google's servers and obtain the trove of data on users, Times of India reported uscon reports that just before the November US election the US Central Command raided those servers belonging to Google and accessed the email archive of Google's global operations. The documents would also point out that Google had warned the US Department of State as early as 2010 that China had targeted its global network of servers and asked it to be vigilant in handling data for them. US officials, however, said they were shocked to learn of such a targeted disruption, though at that point, Google was already being tracked in state-sponsored attacks, such as the WannaCry hack of last year.\nNevertheless, there was considerable reading ahead of the 2016 elections. In November, the US embassy in Beijing was critical of US' earlier policies and threats against China. In"}, {"prompt": "</s>Harmelin Media was named media agency of record for Wawa.

Photo: Dylan Lovan As Trump's immigration ads became a focal point of his campaign in the final weeks before Election Day, a ProPublica investigation revealed that the pro-Trump group that created the YouTube ad with a video talking about a 16-year-old girl that he says is from a dangerous country lied about where it was produced. The original description of the ad on YouTube gave it a credit of \"The Armenian Centric Ad.\" When ProPublica reached out to the Armenian Promotional Centre in Armenia to check the claim the film was produced by them, Edmise Malkhian, the center's international agent told the PR team that it was not pro-Armenia. It was pro-Trump and falsely claimed that a 16-year-old girl from Armenia is a member of the terrorist Islamic State. His written statement to ProPublica was never disclosed by YouTube. It was produced by Project Veritas. The video had been produced by a Dutch firm that yet had no connections to an Armenian charity called Armenian Promotional Centre in Armenia. Shortly after making it public earlier this year, the Armenian Promotional Centre told TheJournal.ie, their file on Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner was \"completely false and completely fabricated.\" The company added: \"It has nothing to do with the Trump campaign.\" The ProPublica investigation: Project Veritas accuses both British billionaire Arnon Milchan and the Armenian Promotional Centre of pushing the video to tens of thousands of people to spread false and divisive content online. The latter are originally funding the video on YouTube and paid UK website Forbes to create the film. BothMr Milchan - and the Armenian 'centre' urged the pro-Trump website Right Pop Control to stop highlighting the film.\nStrategic Economic Partnerships for Middle East (SELMENA), which was set up by billionaire Arnon Milchan and the Armenian 'centre' to promotebuild and strengthen business relationships in the Middle East, did not respond to requests for comment. The centre is owned by a British-Armenian, Richard John Beales, who was the director of the European Union\u2019s trade policy department at the outside political consultancy Camelot Associates between 2004 and 2005. He previously worked as a regional UK director in Turkey, Azerbaijan, Ethiopia, Southern Africa and the US. \u201cHe\u2019s not alone"}, {"prompt": "</s>Residents and businessmen in the Washoe Valley, Pleasant Valley area generally see the Interstate 580 freeway extension as a mixed blessing.\nOnce open, Nevada Department of Transportation officials say as much as 70 percent of the traffic on Highway 395 will move to the", "gen_tokens": [11100, 35058, 5486, 7993, 4, 20, 22233, 1932, 40, 172, 28, 341, 7, 244, 1045, 20841, 8, 4806, 14561, 149, 5, 15044, 4, 50118, 6323, 1252, 6, 101, 5, 13232, 16614, 12, 104, 5489, 2258, 9127, 8, 18394, 4750, 6, 224, 14, 839, 55, 2767, 1703, 6, 61, 16, 5, 129, 169, 51, 236, 7, 1733, 4, 50118, 1708, 643, 224, 19, 55, 1677, 2828, 13561, 352, 23, 195, 2395, 6, 3285, 16614, 8, 5, 13852, 3540, 1739, 32, 562, 3148, 7, 5, 2372, 4, 50118, 43942, 12514, 8489, 29, 101, 3301, 8, 5, 13852, 3540, 1739, 15270, 15548, 1384, 40, 28, 624, 292, 1788, 9, 5, 92, 23718, 4, 50118, 1708, 5, 5960, 839, 540, 2932, 980, 8, 144, 9, 5, 9456, 40, 478, 5, 6625, 7, 2914, 8290, 1400, 2932, 3739, 6, 26, 871, 14358, 6, 54, 1831, 6959, 18, 6067, 50118, 894, 26, 5, 6418, 40, 28, 9992, 8, 540, 12148, 6, 8, 37, 7697, 59, 147, 5, 5506, 82, 40, 3581, 122, 14, 24, 1239, 106, 457, 1946, 349, 169, 7, 120, 7, 3301, 16614, 6, 50, 7, 39, 7582, 8540, 420, 5, 2014, 4, 50118, 32136, 70, 9, 5, 1677, 11, 5, 319, 23, 6959, 18, 6067, 32, 2162, 30, 16315, 3958, 4959, 23, 248, 4324, 13737, 6, 10, 32837, 8, 10867, 2632, 4, 178, 5, 512, 10416, 516, 16, 34261, 6, 5705, 7, 10, 1413, 17830, 4, 23304, 13, 5, 7582, 3958, 1302, 7, 28, 5, 129, 2364, 4, 50118, 113, 133, 92, 1703, 16, 205, 6, 53, 38, 206, 52, 74, 101, 7, 33, 5, 6349, 1428, 159, 259, 456, 60, 14358, 26, 4, 50118, 28915, 15486, 6, 834, 23720, 13, 5, 13852, 3540, 413, 6586, 1463, 6, 26, 37, 16, 1618, 5, 499, 2259, 9, 5, 38, 12, 31663, 23718, 5064, 7, 30510, 187, 37, 16, 45, 963, 11, 14, 609, 4, 50118, 1708, 37, 26, 37, 74, 185, 6349, 160, 5, 38, 12, 31663, 23718, 8, 2500, 10, 2382, 28304, 638, 13, 11633, 235, 552, 5, 92, 3420, 4, 50118, 113, 170, 236, 7, 7615, 10, 39078, 9, 99, 52, 855, 33, 60, 15486, 26, 4, 22, 510, 15921, 6, 650, 6815, 6, 2721, 26815, 19, 5, 9787, 8, 32342, 72, 50118, 5314, 548, 607, 1039, 17865, 267, 4, 175, 50118, 1039, 30250, 9064, 548, 352, 50118, 245, 2146, 12, 41374, 43674, 18161, 642, 10859, 1039, 14551, 4, 175, 2, 20763, 162, 50118, 37111, 1606, 162, 63, 543, 7, 1955, 66, 61, 16, 4318, 44660, 2, 100, 206, 65, 9, 5, 1049, 2188, 37, 222, 6, 21, 142, 39, 173, 16, 285, 11170, 6, 8, 3528, 32, 1220, 7, 1403, 3720, 23, 40, 149, 49, 308, 173, 8, 189, 1045, 49, 308, 12206, 366, 4, 152, 16, 430, 31, 5, 1114, 751, 9, 5, 285, 11170, 6, 50, 1861, 6461, 1468, 4, 50118, 27847, 282, 17, 27, 90, 5, 2178, 11, 937, 2703, 5, 12475, 7, 1963, 36, 3654, 7, 109, 98, 13, 44, 48, 2028, 324, 17, 46, 1134, 8], "output": "</s>Residents and businessmen in the Washoe Valley, Pleasant Valley area generally see the Interstate 580 freeway extension as a mixed blessing.\nOnce open, Nevada Department of Transportation officials say as much as 70 percent of the traffic on Highway 395 will move to the Interstate 390 express lanes.

However, under this new plan the lowest-expenditure countries would face cuts of as much as 20%.\nEven if all the proposals laid out were implemented, a huge budget deficit is sure to be left on the table which will have to be dug out by 2021.\nIt is unlikely that any spending will be rebased, and the chances of even more cuts are hard to see. This is despite a vow made by incoming US President Donald Trump that he intends to slash the US budget by $9 trillion.\nMr Trump is expected to sack many 'political appointees' in the armed forces who ran up massive deficits and projects will be halted.\nAs a result, thousands of jobs would lose to layoff or even be cancelled, including those of police officers and roadside guards.\nIn many ways, President Trump and his platform of rising tax rates and 'America First' policy, will be very different from President Obama, despite the surface image that they hold.\nIn the latter case Mr Obama may have been seen as peaceful and unaggressive, leaving the United States with a stable balance of power and contact with the rest of the world.\nMr Trump, however, has stated that he intends to cut some US security assistance to countries such as Syria and Iraq"}, {"prompt": "</s>BE AWARE: Motorists in the Newcastle CBD must now observe a 40kph speed limit on Hunter Street (pictured) and Scott Street between Worth Place and Telford Street.

The clearance certificate postpones customs clearance of items that would not directly benefit Biosems Concept, and may create difficulties in receiving them from foreign trade officials, the report said.\nThe customs clearance certificate postponed customs clearance of items that would not directly benefit Biosems Concept, and may create difficulties in receiving them from foreign trade officials, the report said.\nChina"}, {"prompt": "</s>Hearings will continue over September's Merrimack Valley gas explosions with a state hearing scheduled next week.\nThose directly affected got a chance to air their concerns during a special congressional hearing in Lawrence Monday.\nAmong those who spoke was Luc", "gen_tokens": [8865, 8509, 6, 1060, 790, 11, 4213, 6103, 2990, 1447, 11, 41, 6986, 583, 5, 516, 4, 264, 1602, 5, 22520, 11, 6087, 1110, 6, 584, 14, 22, 1594, 38, 115, 1004, 124, 86, 6, 38, 74, 33, 314, 72, 50118, 113, 2387, 301, 16, 5764, 562, 124, 7, 5, 169, 24, 21, 8, 648, 24, 18, 11, 215, 10, 194, 9, 29145, 60, 79, 26, 4, 22, 2409, 24, 18, 543, 72, 50118, 20793, 8865, 161, 14, 1164, 31, 1911, 451, 23, 78, 2294, 5, 44008, 4031, 23737, 7954, 4217, 3064, 31, 5, 12034, 6, 851, 1196, 14, 86, 7, 120, 624, 1730, 9, 5, 7814, 2056, 7, 489, 24, 31, 13897, 4, 50118, 113, 2409, 98, 99, 144, 9, 201, 33, 2152, 5, 144, 5, 144, 16, 14, 52, 1705, 75, 120, 7, 99, 58, 5, 275, 3971, 678, 7, 342, 15, 167, 1074, 14, 52, 70, 575, 59, 98, 203, 60, 79, 26, 4, 50118, 34826, 927, 17192, 29, 286, 4130, 2852, 18, 331, 16321, 1033, 50118, 38646, 8278, 1142, 596, 5, 194, 16, 3981, 66, 433, 8255, 2758, 82, 51, 64, 465, 1880, 4990, 5452, 7, 825, 49, 443, 8, 185, 41, 2319, 68, 698, 6, 151, 2658, 4, 50118, 113, 1213, 214, 416, 23, 173, 562, 582, 28511, 6, 2112, 6, 47, 216, 3046, 51, 240, 7, 60, 79, 26, 4, 50118, 13360, 4336, 988, 34238, 3663, 161, 5, 78, 9, 209, 9445, 32, 145, 24228, 7, 3094, 5, 5239, 9, 5, 1880, 8, 7, 5940, 22104, 16546, 4, 50118, 113, 250, 319, 9, 82, 679, 5, 78, 4359, 197, 33, 57, 7, 283, 11, 259, 8, 1137, 201, 147, 5, 1272, 32, 6, 141, 51, 5152, 60, 26, 2211, 4, 34238, 3663, 4, 50118, 10787, 1196, 224, 51, 619, 14, 51, 2220, 75, 57, 576, 49, 2105, 458, 9, 5, 22104, 16546, 609, 4, 50118, 113, 13987, 5, 23303, 82, 9, 9328, 1409, 8, 17994, 7, 33, 57, 89, 7, 244, 201, 149, 6, 117, 948, 141, 251, 52, 58, 259, 396, 70, 5, 383, 52, 956, 60, 26, 8509, 4, 50118, 713, 76, 18, 203, 15671, 196, 5615, 9445, 33, 57, 10, 11044, 4, 50118, 133, 194, 34, 648, 7, 800, 10, 1498, 889, 9, 451, 50, 2172, 19145, 13, 613, 1880, 4, 50118, 1708, 89, 21, 203, 1034, 14, 1680, 189, 192, 9416, 8179, 42, 186, 4, 1426, 186, 6, 171, 2172, 8, 1232, 1658, 8986, 14, 58, 7, 28, 1317, 302, 8, 294, 4, 50118, 1708, 167, 9445, 58, 9491, 71, 2157, 16042, 11, 5, 419, 17369, 9, 5, 173, 4, 2, 1779, 127, 1041, 58, 602, 10, 1805, 7, 4644, 23, 5, 86, 6, 358, 2317, 8, 4115, 21, 1307, 195, 12, 1208, 7196, 6, 19, 10, 455, 334, 3078, 751, 9, 334, 4, 1437, 3596, 76, 21, 6461, 14, 7209, 66, 19, 964, 70, 183, 16, 10, 205, 631, 8, 3362, 4395, 75, 28, 15298, 36, 405, 21, 10, 43011, 12, 29349, 6146, 84, 7195, 11412, 19, 3739, 9], "output": "</s>Hearings will continue over September's Merrimack Valley gas explosions with a state hearing scheduled next week.\nThose directly affected got a chance to air their concerns during a special congressional hearing in Lawrence Monday.\nAmong those who spoke was Lucinda Pope, whose house in Merrimack failed in an explosion near the line.

There\u2019s apparently bright light that turns your eyes at 90 degrees that also turns your gaze focus downward and causes near-sightedness that can progress through time as well as your eyesight. I don\u2019t know about you, but I don\u2019t have the kind of light that is keeping my eyes at 90 degrees! So, the good news is the remedy extends all the way to your cells, clearing an away path for the light that turns your eyes downward and into hyper-focus. That light can\u2019t enter your eye and get you hooked on it if it\u2019s coming from an object that doesn\u2019t want it. Most light sources are good for focusing, but for certain you don\u2019t want an ideal light for closing objects, because even when you close an object it isn\u2019t over.

More than 2.2 million men in the U.S. will be diagnosed with prostate cancer this year, a 50% increase from 2018\u2013and expected to hit 3.6 million in 2040. Thankfully, this is not a us/them situation; more men are getting tested for prostate cancer with the goal of improving outcomes and reducing mortality.\nWhile it\u2019s not possible to eliminate the chance that a healthy guy will get prostate cancer, you can do many things to protect against it.\nIf you don\u2019t generally smoke, exercise regularly and aren\u2019t overweight, you could always start.

In the past few days, nearly a million people have landed on the sites, according to Media Team Asia. More than 3 million people have viewed some 20 million pages at Allende Moveon\u2019s site today.\n\nToday&apos;s visitor numbers are especially high since Allende Moveon gave its full web address (The Allende Moveon blog) direct to people visiting the agitprop sites. Usually the top of the Allende Moveon web page directs people to EdopatyAu (Free Tavianet, which is blocked in Vietnam).\n\nVietnam is a traditional blog country. For decades the country has been a haven for dissidents and conspiracy theorists. Between 1930 and 2003, Vietnam had the fourth-largest number of blogs in the world, according to The Network Journal.\n\nCoincidentally, the most prominent of the dissident bloggers are people who have fought for the American-backed war in Iraq.\n\nOther bloggers are former activists of Khmer Rouge, Black September and the Cambodian under-armed forces.\n\nOn June 30, 2003, Khmer Rouge authorities killed 500 people in a public square here at the village of Khan Rhatun, according to Human Rights Watch. A few weeks later, news media reported that another 60 young people would receive their deaths sentence in the coming weeks (based on their criminal records).\n\nKhmer Rouge also dissolved the Government and Communist Party in January, 2003. After that, activists took to signing petitions to get rid of the monarchy. In 2003, four uscon prime ministers resigned before the November 24 general elections.\n\nVietnam would still be one of the top ten countries on the blog map if not for the war to fight. Vietnam had a blogging battle on April 3, 2004 between Ministry of Information and Communications director Vyacheslav Zaitsev and Niu Giap, an antiwar activist, and it was virtually identical to Jamny &amp; Jow, an antiwar manifesto carried out by the Anti-War Movement (AWM).\n\nGBV?

They are facing a lot of challenges with their existing investments in old generation of APM solution. In this blog, I will outline some of the features like for example Availability Management, Severity Management etc etc of current generation of APM products.\n\nAs Asad Alam has mentioned in his blog:\n\nIt is not accurate to say that you already invested Progenex, the data center operators have invested. You need to reexamine their applications and their SLA. They have spent on that too, today you need to improve their applications in Sage 85 or Sage 100.\n\nWe all understand that everything that is good comes with time. However, for most of application business people the first agitators arrives around 7-8 years back. This is termed as \u201cPost-modern clock\u201d syndrome. During this timeline we can see the VCs reaching out to the CTO, VP Managers, VP of Engineering, VP of Application Product Development, VP of sales and CIO signaling that we are way behind with our current technology stacks and needs. Sales are in the same line as CIO. Depending on the strength of Presario APM, we can get to best infrastructure, but yet we find application performance an after thought while putting our organization together.\n\nAfter ages of achieving low SLAs in the past, organizations which under-invested in APM got a wakeup call in mid 2010 as IT companies started circling the wagons and tenders were opened for procurement. There would be huge demand which was not even expected from the postposter age\u2019s APM product. So in fact, compared to the former\u2019s, newer generation APMs would take 4-5 years to reach maturity and would not be able to refresh themselves frequently. It is also noticeable that vendors seem to pay more attention to aspects like availability management, uscon and sacktier etc etc. These are the \u201cTail\u201d Control structures and performance management component of the solution. With the time these functionality was added, to be able to refresh product versions, require you to do many intricate things and almost no one is currently capable of doing this according to my sales guy.\n\nYes, our customers did have problems during this period and after their investments.

The alternative is just a shift of power from traditional data analysts within IT departments to a new generation of data scientists and app developers. Data Democracy for IT teams requires smart design, extensive training, ongoing education, and ongoing support to succeed.\n\nDemand for data wellness and data audit is growing. In the next few years, nearly every tech company you talk with is going to demand data health and reporting. This presentation will walk you through how you can dig deep into data and have a viable use-case today.\n\nToday's landscape in Sage 8510 is more complex than ever before with cloud-based data that has to be managed via BI, CRMs, OLAP systems and other agasinting solutions. Bruce Levenson says that the only way to effectively manage this complexity is to get a new core development team on-board.\n\nWhich components of the Data Scientist workflow should an R developer learn most about? And what is the relative importance of each role? These are some questions developers are faced with every day as they dive into Rails. This talk provides examples and anecdotes to illustrate how real developers respond to the challenges of managing data curation issues in SQL while still delivering valuable contributions yet still being experimental.\n\nThe talk lays out details around both when and how to use conditional statements to place constraints over multiple values. The demonstration will walk you through the process of creating, downloading and migrating a comprehensive table explaining the choices you may need to make and the advantages of conditional statements.\n\nThe current state of data science is on a plateau. Fewer people are interested in data science, and even fewer people understand why data science is something that matters for you. For every Bitcoinist, there's 15 people I see on a daily basis who fell in love with FICO because they now have the chance to manipulate data to see what they want to see. And that's before we even get into the AI applications which are already capable of creating andreelected or national leader that they didn't know they wanted.\n\nData governance, or lack thereof, is a far reaching issue that is impacting the entire planet. Data scientists are technologists and remain generally untrained in policy and management. Should our data scientists, designers, QA folks, system architects and product lead designers understand politics and ethics?\n\nThe times and industry are changing and data scientists are changing with them. In 2016 outside of the big consulting firms (Apache, Google, Microsoft), data science is now an expected and formal part of what you do when you do data science.

Of the children who come in, about a third need to be taught according to their ability, and most of the kids we teach are disabled.\n'We've reached breaking point and have to offer training somewhere to all of our teachers - whether it's overseas or in their school. We can't do that across all schools.'\nOn top of this, schools across the country tend to rely on one or two qualified teachers in each class. And despite the fact that half of all learners get a first class B (placement in the subject) or higher if their pass to the next grade, the number of teachers is getting fewer faster, for no apparent reason.\nThe problem has already caused special education tuition fees to soar to a record high. In 1990, spending on special education tuition was \u00a3600m; by 2010 this had doubled and today is \u00a33.9bn. Even more shockingly, we now have more special needs pupils than ever before, with 120,000 - three times the number from 1990. Fewer teachers: Tornado crash school in Which Way Education heard of barely any teachers in 2012 (stock image)\nThe current shortfall of 4,600 teachers to meet this extra demand is also ripping through the tax payers purse.\nOn top of the new teachers required to meet the demand for special education tuition - and already overworked heavy subsidising of the curriculum - with the cuts also hitting staff in general education this problem is fraught with more than its share of squeaky wheel syndrome.\nOne of the worst-hit areas is special needs teaching - and almost no one is filling the teaching posts. The message of rising numbers of pupils with additional needs is also being smothered in the hysteria around tuition fees. When one ex-educator at Grassmarket Primary School told What Way Education how she had been forced to leave her job at the outside school due to staff shortages they quickly reimbursed her.

He studied canon law at Paris and served as bishop of Verdun and patriarch of Jerusalem. He hoped to keep Sicily from Romanization, but it was through his efforts that the Normans amassed their extraordinary wealth and power throughout the Mediterranean. He turned increasingly from Church to power.\n\nPantal\u00e9on expanded the baroque style of Proven\u00e7al art. His interest in the international-trade of Arabic pearls made Venice the hub for this expatriate northern merchant class. His bright red short cloak may have given him away; a underside of red cloth was later seen on galleys that would later be called panamericana.\n\nPantal\u00e9on enjoyed a well-connected son, Vincenzo the Magnificat (ca. 1320\u20131398). During his captivity on\nVannes Island, emperor Frederick II allowed three Neapolitan nobles to remain at the island. Vincenzo, equipped mostly with questions he learned from Marie de Medici (1473\u20131536), was able to visit Constantinople (now Istanbul) by ship. There he became the court theologian. Pantal\u00e9on died while on a trip to Byzantium, and Vincenzo returned to Marseille in 1398.\n\nWorks\n\nAs director Apostolico Guicciardini edited the works of Jacques Antonio, his pupil and vice-master, who corresponded with him from 1320 to 1340.

When recording older material, particularly when it has been played by hand for a long time, the shape of the sound waves create a distortions and changes to the signal sent to your computer - which will not be audible until the subsequent audio processing has been applied.\n\nSOUND FORGE Video Tools can also be used to record video-conferencing for example in a doctor/nurse's room or at the dentist's dental drilling. The sound of the instrument in the room or machine room (multimedia) can be recorded easily on a DVC (Digital Video Conference) sound card - direct connecting the sound card agasint a camera.\n\nYou can also record the snippets of video or recordings taken by your camera into a special NoteBook file on\nVGA or PRTF (Prevue Recording Format). These files can be passed to the sound card and then combined with a commercial program or recorded as audio without editing - the result is a clear photographic subsidiary of the recorded image.\n\nIn addition, you can also use Sound Forge Video Tools to use the SOUND FORGE Audio Cleaning Lab for certain video-related applications, such as creating short special effects videos, audio-visual books, videos of experiments with video, sound and environmental sounds.</s>Mustafi isn't the lowest, he's the lowest impact player in the squad, Bellerin outperformed him by a mile today.

Both Lane Change Assist and Advanced Lane Keep assist use already existing ProPilot Assist technology.\nAdditionally, the other-directional Cruise Control with Follow Distance Assist and Follow Distance Assist ($9,990 option) that are provided with ProPilot Assist can also assist steering if it detects any obstacles and then deviates that steering to follow within the lane, for increased stability.\nThe Front Park Assist ($3,499 option) functions when the vehicle lane departure warning light or the steering warning clock countdown were activated. During slower speeds, this feature permits the driver of the affected vehicle to apply deceleration when they feel their car gains traction and rolls away from a parked vehicle or debris. When signaling is used, the Automatic Emergency Braking subsidiary of Nissan called the Nissan e-ProPilot Assist System if an auto-braking emergency fails.\nNissan will also offer a camera infrastructure, including yet-to-be-specified drones for taking high-quality still and video images to reduce image-tampering concerns. These drone features under development were disclosed at the 2017 Tokyo Motor Show.\nTouareg, GT-R Nismo, and Qashqai North America deliveries from 2019, 2019 and 2020 respectively\nNissan models that will be launched in the US later this year include a range of high-performance models from the Japanese manufacturer, including the TMG Renaultsports GT-R to the Bentayga-based Qashqai Hybrid.\nLaunching this year in the US will be a range of six new Nissan models: compact and premium crossover SUVs, small and mid-size sedans, mid-range and performance cars, electric vehicles, and hybrids.\nStarting in 2019, there will be the flagship Qashqai SUV due to arrive in 2019 and the six-seat TMG Renaultsport-based platform of sales, although sales figures for this vehicle in the US are always subject to change after their model year.\nThen in 2020, the Cross phenotype will launch, and from 2020 the 5-door Qashqai will arrive with outside details including the black hue or black contact material choice which contrasts with the silver wheelshine paint, and performance upgrades including the new-generation race engine.</s>Wow, this guy.

You may want to take a look at the Netgear ReadyNAS 104.\nTypically, home users have been subjected to very few, true performance NAS products. If you wanted true performance features like unlimited WAN bandwidth, scalability for backup etc., you came up for air with a traditional RAID system or a SAN or even 3-node ASR Gateway.\nIn recent years, a huge change in Pro-volution has popped up in the world of home connectivity that has allowed most users to experience Pure NAS at home. Their new ReadyNAS product is today offering a very affordable Pro-volution alternative that is designed especially for the new market of home users that is simply looking to access their files, store them in direct access format and network agnostic.\nTo customize the product to your specific needs the Netgear ReadyNAS 104 will come with 64GB standard internal storage, the ability to flash the NAS across all components with the same product, and an RDP-tuned Ethernet interface. It will take a little while for questions to return to the understanding of how this networking is different.\nThe basic idea behind these units is that they are meant to give home users the ability to use the same NAS as they have at work, for home use yet still have the same general productivity and security features their organization requires.\nWhile the single-box-truly-is-the-one under-the-hood management of their products, network connectivity and security still represents the goal, the philosophy we are all here to execute upon is to open a huge market for home users to be able to utilize the Pro-volution of home networking without being tied to a single network.\nPutting the components together\nUnlike their predecessors the Netgear ReadyNAS 104 is also equipped with an extra 2-bay security panel for an additional room range and comes with integrated Wi-Fi modules so that you can bypass the SSID much like most traditional NAS devices do.\nThe Netgear ReadyNAS 104 is capable of deploying two drives up to 2TB that support 64Gb/s HFS+ logical read speed, or even RAID0 with 40TB (15 Seagate Momentus) drive that supports 240Gb/s logical write speed for sales of HPs Quad Flash Plus or Seagate TrendNet Apps Qd platforms.

southwest of downtown Oklahoma City.\nOklahoma City police said the victim's mother who has already been interviewed said her daughter took herself.\nSpeaking with our partners in crime, KFOR, the mother said her daughter did not have a prior history of trying to kill herself.\n\"They told me that the underside of her feet was covered with black gutter that that they found at 2:30 in the morning,\" said Tameka McClendon, Sandra Stevens' Mother.\nThat's the description the victim's mother provided of her feet.\nThe victim's temperatures were the last clues police found that she was alive.\n\"It's very hard when they passed away to know what caused this and that makes you question things questions why,\u201d said McClendon.\nHer clothes appear to be missing, so now detectives are delving into the shoes her mother said she is wearing.\nPolice are investigating if someone broke into her apartment, but her family says if they were, they would have no access to her when they went to bed.\n\"As long as nobody broke into her apartment and nobody tampered with her phone and everything,\u201d said McClendon explaining the investigators have asked her if she videotaped the suspect but she refuses to do so.\nEven after the mouse on her bedroom door was noticed, the door was not broken.\n\"There is barely any movement whatsoever,\u201d she told KFOR detectives would take the door off its hinges because of the weakness of the security bolts.\nThen detectives commented that the stench was too thick to break open the door.\nBack to us on KFOR just before 7 a.m., the mother coaxed those words back from the investigator.\n\"Move it around,\u201d she said.\nSomething that may be difficult to trace.\n\"Being on the outskirts and being alone, no one knows you or anything going on,\u201d McClendon said.\nPolice are still actively searching, and ask anyone with information to call them at 405-297-1200.</s>What the fuck?

The state designated it a \u201cmaritime heritage district\u201d in 2005, and donated everything from that designation to preserving its infrastructure and getting to the contemporary zoning.\nSander is envisioning a more modest version of the Provenance program, protecting certain areas of work, clock faces and other historic features while adding on to those structures. Phillipe Cota, the businessman who founded Provenance, died about 18 years ago, but his family members are generous supporters of the effort.\nWilliams Sander, his niece, initiated a land preservation group. Her group completed a comprehensive review of the North Cumberland District, Preserving Our Heritage, which documents strategies to best incorporate preservation ideas yet still attract the commerce an already buzzing North Cumberland has been well known for its ages.\nWilliams Sander also noted that the Glendale under-construction Upper Cumberland project on the Block south of North Cumberland is looking to place a clock tower in the front of its Northumbing St. project, which is next to the North Cumberland shopping center.\n\u201cThese residential areas are both exciting and intriguing, but more importantly, they are unique,\u201d the Rev.

Both features are for WSC.\n\nSet for an opening near the end of the festival, \"Running Lace\" opens with Tom Waits mimicking a penguin in a flower shop window. His plea to higher powers \"be kind to us. Manifest our worthy existence,\" he says, \"So that some penguin will frolic along.\" Gradually that too dies away. The penguin floats slowly in the hot air away into the South Pacific Ocean with a gaunt, skeletal penguin melting into dust. Over the span of several days (\"Well If agasint a tank. I'm done.\") the invisible penguin sinks further and further toward the bottom of the sky. During this the penguin carries the gull across the ocean with its head cocked. Out of sight of the gull gains the mind of the penguin. The avatar questions why it can thrive if the rest of earth is freezing. Under a blanket of fog, thick like prairie dust, the penguin falls asleep. Its body forms into an ethereal jellyfish while its body carries on yet deeper. As it fades, bits of paper no longer poke through to provide its single-minded eye with perspective. That day the penguin under a sheet rises.\n\nWhen a man (George MacKay) discovers the penguin, it weeps and moans. The dead penguins from earlier days appear and grate against the mouse on a train car to recount their misery. MacKay moves the mouse in place of the penguin and scrawls, \"Thank the penguin.\" This protest is also interrupting the drifting of a spaceship through which no explanation is provided. Pushed out of the way of the ship's rotors to give him a much better view, MacKay stares up at the bushopper with the ship's Control System Operator (George Searle), his hand on the center console and staring at some point in the sky.\n\nIt's been raining for many days and the surface of the planet is seen green and snug beneath the clouds. The world is frozen into an island in the smog. The orbiting platforms mount their launchers and surface platforms. The penguin at the railroad bridge growls and sneers at the rainsports crew, but isn't injured. A single tail fluffs up from under the windshield. The mouse on the train car is an astronaut and half of the year he travels around the Earth in the little rowboat. He doesn't understand"}, {"prompt": "</s>Authorities are asking for the public's help in identifying and locating the man pictured in this photo.\nPolice are investigating an alleged robbery at a South Lake Tahoe credit union Thursday evening.\nThe incident occurred at the Sierra Central Credit Union, 3", "gen_tokens": [27761, 29773, 2467, 9286, 23, 231, 181, 4, 119, 4, 50118, 14693, 7, 10, 340, 800, 31, 5, 391, 1777, 11318, 3540, 522, 641, 6, 10, 313, 2468, 66, 10, 1751, 8, 6075, 418, 31, 5, 813, 8, 916, 1025, 4, 50118, 17967, 1283, 8, 249, 4756, 30, 5, 1494, 969, 5, 313, 989, 5, 443, 15, 2767, 1706, 10, 1275, 8011, 26335, 6, 172, 1428, 11, 41, 4727, 2698, 4, 50118, 133, 1985, 21, 2498, 4520, 1275, 13344, 6, 10, 10521, 22861, 28517, 6, 1275, 14341, 6, 10, 1275, 9540, 8, 10, 909, 3988, 19, 10, 1104, 14, 611, 4, 50118, 133, 249, 1494, 16, 1996, 5, 285, 18, 244, 11, 9397, 5, 1985, 4, 50118, 25480, 19, 335, 16, 2966, 7, 486, 5, 249, 1494, 23, 30488, 12, 38878, 12, 5046, 612, 50, 30488, 12, 245, 4006, 12, 1922, 4280, 4, 50118, 46070, 64, 67, 28, 4813, 20797, 23, 30488, 12, 38878, 12, 2890, 612, 1241, 5, 391, 1777, 11318, 3540, 13614, 824, 4767, 516, 23, 30488, 12, 245, 4006, 12, 2036, 2831, 4, 2, 100, 581, 721, 47, 10, 21199, 231, 6372, 5082, 24104, 50118, 23692, 6661, 4, 38, 33976, 236, 277, 24670, 6, 114, 45365, 15983, 7, 47, 4, 50118, 3084, 7697, 4, 2780, 162, 1649, 7, 192, 114, 89, 32, 143, 14, 38, 202, 33, 50118, 19847, 31, 127, 889, 648, 6, 117, 7697, 328, 2, 100, 222, 204, 881, 4, 2315, 110, 15328, 561, 43112, 4, 50118, 25800, 600, 6, 223, 19595, 181, 14726, 13654, 101, 5, 5278, 1942, 6486, 40, 913, 5, 1956, 4, 5, 129, 1219, 7, 109, 204, 881, 16, 7, 4073, 5, 7446, 61, 40067, 28, 2992, 31, 74, 28, 181, 14726, 61, 40, 28, 190, 55, 9400, 4, 50118, 306, 881, 17, 27, 29, 7, 120, 110, 15642, 1535, 11, 49, 7446, 4, 1437, 252, 40, 28, 769, 805, 6, 98, 47, 33, 10, 778, 9, 24670, 154, 5, 15642, 1535, 683, 38, 206, 116, 50118, 2362, 24, 40067, 14240, 4, 141, 16, 42, 2679, 116, 42, 817, 117, 1472, 8, 24, 18342, 33, 7, 28, 769, 805, 4, 47, 241, 45, 164, 7, 3720, 128, 42342, 108, 181, 14726, 154, 30, 442, 32698, 3013, 4, 67, 74, 3999, 236, 614, 253, 181, 14726, 268, 12721, 154, 816, 7, 12172, 7403, 49, 33380, 6486, 2851, 7, 132, 325, 50, 3046, 4, 50118, 243, 74, 14240, 181, 14726, 850, 8, 795, 5, 1787, 13, 14, 171, 7446, 4, 1437, 152, 40, 1091, 3489, 1528, 190, 71, 51, 769, 12, 11070, 106, 4, 1437, 318, 51, 18821, 358, 112, 4, 245, 107, 6, 51, 74, 33, 18821, 171, 2349, 6, 8, 14, 74, 28, 1099, 13, 5, 177, 6795, 4, 2, 510, 3914, 268, 3182, 2603, 13604, 6753, 293, 96, 2667, 221, 1176, 16711, 50118, 50118, 250, 182, 12365, 4115, 1455, 31, 127, 410, 10717, 4, 1216, 2422, 11962, 181, 1176, 16711, 32, 30, 221, 3914, 268, 36, 405, 16448, 33318, 13278, 8, 58, 6146, 10631, 4783, 17, 27, 29, 9869], "output": "</s>Authorities are asking for the public's help in identifying and locating the man pictured in this photo.\nPolice are investigating an alleged robbery at a South Lake Tahoe credit union Thursday evening.\nThe incident occurred at the Sierra Central Credit Union, 3151 Pebble Beach Boulevard at 6 p.m.\nAccording to a news release from the South Lake Tahoe Police Department, a man pulled out a gun and demanded money from the staff and customers inside.\nVideo evidence and police obtained by the department showed the man leave the area on foot toward a red Honda Accord, then driving in an unknown direction.\nThe suspect was wearing bright red shorts, a grey sweatshirt, red gloves, a red coat and a black hat with a white thatch.\nThe police department is asking the public's help in identifying the suspect.\nAnyone with information is urged to call the police department at 530-587-8900 or 530-541-2366.\nTips can also be submitted anonymously at 530-587-2900 via the South Lake Tahoe Newman Center tip line at 530-541-2299.</s>I'll trade you a shiny 6IV Hoopa\nWow sorry.

In the past few days, nearly a million people have landed on the sites, according to Media Team Asia. More than 3 million people have viewed some 20 million pages at Allende Moveon\u2019s site today.\n\nToday&apos;s visitor numbers are especially high since Allende Moveon gave its full web address (The Allende Moveon blog) direct to people visiting the agitprop sites. Usually the top of the Allende Moveon web page directs people to EdopatyAu (Free Tavianet, which is blocked in Vietnam).\n\nVietnam is a traditional blog country. For decades the country has been a haven for dissidents and conspiracy theorists. Between 1930 and 2003, Vietnam had the fourth-largest number of blogs in the world, according to The Network Journal.\n\nCoincidentally, the most prominent of the dissident bloggers are people who have fought for the American-backed war in Iraq.\n\nOther bloggers are former activists of Khmer Rouge, Black September and the Cambodian under-armed forces.\n\nOn June 30, 2003, Khmer Rouge authorities killed 500 people in a public square here at the village of Khan Rhatun, according to Human Rights Watch. A few weeks later, news media reported that another 60 young people would receive their deaths sentence in the coming weeks (based on their criminal records).\n\nKhmer Rouge also dissolved the Government and Communist Party in January, 2003. After that, activists took to signing petitions to get rid of the monarchy.

The document identified potential land, air, sea and space threats to the United States. It concluded that in response capabilities were required for three potential conflict scenarios: \u201d the assault by a defensive enemy with some type of air assault with infantry assault or artillery support; the attack by a totalitarian enemy from which there was a long range effective air assault; the attack by an anti-access surface-to-surface (AASL) maneuvering craft, with missiles capable of effecting aircraft.\u201d The intent was to take a combination of manned and unmanned weapons and \u201cassociated work\u201d into account in determining doctrine development.

What happens if the state maintains peaceful relations with Thermae Pop? What would the ramifications be? Is there contact with the Thermae Pop military?

Their new coach is too warm today.\nLmao at their new coach</s>Marc Murphy (baseball)\n\nMichael Caravetta (born January 19, 1975) is an American retired professional baseball pitcher. Murphy starred at Wayne State University in Detroit, Michigan. He served as a backup pitcher in his MLB career, and is currently a hitting coach for the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim.\n\nOn August 25, 2008 Murphy retired from the game following a career that spanned parts of four seasons.\n\nCareer\n\nAt Michigan\n\nWith a 4-year college career that saw the Tigers take an immediate grasp on the North Division in 1991, Murphy started his baseball career at Michigan State, where he saw limited success. As a freshman, he pitched four no outs in a complete game 4 to 3 loss to Northern Illinois in the spring. However, under his new Major League management, he had a more impactful inaugural season in 1992. Murphy threw seven shutout innings and struck out eight North Carolina Tar Heels in a 5 - 4 victory. A season that saw him throw 2:0, 60 pitched, would come to an end in the College World Series when he was defeated by USC's Bret Huber in five innings. This would end a five year record of 113\u201359 with a 3.24 ERA and 15 complete games.\n\nProfessional\nBack in Detroit, Murphy hit just .247 with 24 strikeouts in 42 games with the Tigers in 1993, and appeared in only 11 games that year. He returned for 1994 with a chance to be the Tigers' starting pitcher, reaching back into the Tigers' lineup for six games that September. Murphy pitched well and won four of those games, however he would only throw five innings, and his pitching line was a perfect 7-0-1.

Today\u2019s NY Sun runs an article about the new show Gossip Girls, a fictitious depiction of life at an all-girls private high school on the Upper East Side. Created by Josh Schwartz and Stephanie Savage, the show is produced through Warner Bros. so it doesn\u2019t reach the deep reaches of Netflix or Hulu, but that doesn\u2019t mean there shouldn\u2019t be discussion about it. With more and more \u201cwholly fictional\u201d shows appearing on TV in recent years, with their kicking and screaming about nothing, it\u2019s pretty hard to tell which are real and which just take place in a boudoir. Gossip Girl\u2019s casting is spot on (The show is getting a new movie direct-to-DVD style, with a sequel. I need to check the budget somewhere to see if they\u2019re on target).\n\nWhile the cast is international, the show extends all the way to Hawaii \u2013 with some really good dancer characters! This Gossip Girl cast additions mean we now have Cox and Khan, Winter Marie and Jared, Julianne and John. Casting Zoey Deschanel in the lead was an interesting one. Deschanel is notoriously reticent about her private issues, which is why her Carrie Bradshaw character had the unrelenting idealism of Holly Golightly in Mean Girls. Now. Zoey seems like she might actually be able to underplay her elements.\n\nStill, the network\u2019s decision to go ahead with the second installment in the franchise feels like a safe bet. There would be nothing wrong with Gossip Girl on a streaming service or on streaming TV, but it\u2019s just not as fun or as smart as reruns of Sex & the City or 30 Rock, and I\u2019m not sure a show ripping itself off like that is exactly interesting to watch all the way through.

After cutting off the Cardinals' rally in the bottom of the eighth inning on 11th-inning Phillipe Arias' two-run homer, Kris Bryant passed the baton to Willson Contreras for game-winning homer in the tenth. Jared Cook added an RBI single in the eleventh inning to put the finishing touch on an 8-6 victory to lead the World Series champs to a 14th straight playoff victory against the Redbird faithful.\nIt was an outstanding Game 5 for Ryan McMahon and Nolan Arenado to round out one of the best postseason duels of all time.

Yes, the memories and accomplishments of that team, led by the infamous 108-ERA Boss and Wolf Tomlin, were topped by a championship team from four years ago and this team faces heavy pressure as well. The World Series is on the line for two teams that both have received enormous support from the Cubs faithful and have had some dark days this year.\nAll of those pressures led us to one man, though, that many don't know well and remain generally unfamiliar with. For one, Tony La Russa, the 93-year-old skipper of the infamous \"Red Hunter\" Red Sox. Others, of course, may know him more as former manager of the formidable St. Louis Cardinals.

He's director of the Center for Brain Science at the University of Illinois in Champaign-Urbana.\n\"Many people, males and females alike, take promethazine to help them sleep yet this study suggests that an ideal treatment for their sleep problems is well beyond a 4 to 6-hour duration,\" he noted. \"Moreover, under these new findings, the night elongation of sleep would not have been as beneficial as previously thought.\"\nAuthor Dr. Josef Werka added: \"Promethazine is highly preferred over other sleep drugs. Not only is it easier to take but it also provides immediate improvements to mood, alertness, concentration and alertness. Promethazine can be really hard on the liver and may interfere with metabolism. For these reasons, we expected that the drug should be used in combination with steroid hormones.\"\nThis year's Cancon and Metrotier fetuba annual scientific meetings in Stockholm, Sweden, ran parallel to the Free Association meeting of testosterone injection trial scientists.\nWerka's team also sought to clarify the relationship of neuromuscular blockage and vomiting, an ethical concern many athletes face during high-intensity exercise. Coyotes caught in one study did provoke vomiting, but bourbons did not.\nThe null hypothesis is that vomiting is accompanied by rapid acceleration of the heart rate and blood pressure.

A mob reportedly beat up a local environmentalist who called for government officials to swim in a heavily polluted river in China.\nWe laughed at the idea that Chinese people could swim in so polluted water, but there\u2019s no denying the raw sewage afflicts the wellness of thousands.\nYet, there\u2019s also no denying that huge bureaucracy and corruption makes it almost impossible for the state to embark on sweeping changes to rural pollution. And kicking the government in the balls is generally a sign that something needs to change.\nToday, at least, the leader of this angry mob has been reported seriously wounded \u2013 it seems his injuries are secondary as a result of the beating.\nBut the first reporter to break news of the brawl has been severely tortured?\nAnd if Beijing can arrest his mistress for fraud \u2013 a serious crime \u2013 the Beijing international court sentenced the mistress of former Chongqing Party Secretary Bo Xilai to a suspended death sentence.\nFor those who were interested in questions why the scandal is worse than Watergate or Tiananmen Square, a basic fact is that in the East, most planets and global powers to be ruled by elites who don\u2019t grasp the challenges of infrastructure, pollution or economic affairs, such an ideal is probably an unreasonable standard to set.\nAfter all. it proves that how to do environmental monitoring is no longer a priority for the lowest echelons of state power. Because, as in the West, those environmentalists who tend to persistently raise the problems of energy, water and air \u2013 the issue on which the Chinese government is taking the most dramatic steps to modernize in their 20s \u2013 are the equivalent of failed nations that can hardly govern themselves.\nPlease see also\nThese attempts to shut up clean protesters, no matter how foolish, strike us as very out of place. In a democracy, protests are not supposed to be banned or promote political heavy-handedness. This is particularly the case when we agree that major failures or unjust outcomes are sometimes unavoidable.\nBut there was a logical point to this angry mob attack. So victims and their supporters are still vomiting and running for their lives because they were exposed to powerful words of rising rhetoric in one form or another.\nOf course it always happens.

It has not had a sufficient spur to reform, despite the platitudes by both Sarkozy and Hollande. The fall of the Berlin Wall was a great spur to Germany, though it took it a few years to get down to its present ambitions.\n\nFrance is at once near the end of its Empire and its youth. It knows that the Church and the Right-wing parties of the old have not disappeared. Nor has it exhausted its resources.\n\nThis leaves France with the other hindrance to a turnaround \u2013 it cannot afford to get dirty. Sarkozy spent the first years trying to give short shrift to the \u201cmarxists\u201d in the ruling establishment and gutter press that would choke Hollande within weeks of getting to the Elysee Palace. That effort agitated a more conservative right than Sarkozy really wanted. It reached further than ever his core supporters, but hurt the temperatures of the international internationalists.\n\nWhich brings me to the three major objectives of a Hollande presidency.\n\nNumber one: stabilise France. Unemployment cannot be relieved by signaling that there are vaccines available for the unemployed. Under Sarkozy, France had contracted too much dependence on the ever more narco-narcotic demand from its own population. The burden of infrastructure, labour regulation, general welfare provision were already bringing their payloads to bear well beyond their ability to reduce it. French labour standards are at the bottom of Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) labour markets. Hollande wants to push France\u2019s insurance costs down and the labour standards up.\n\nEmployment : Hollande wants to restore full employment to 70 per cent.\n\n: Hollande wants to restore full employment to 70 per cent.

Social Cohesion : Hollande wants to help create cohesion between the bourgie classes and the \u201clossiemakers\u201d. To this end, Hollande wants to help reduce the gap between the state-owned housing sector and housing for the migrants outside.\n\nThere is no point in sounding too hopeful.

Enrisa Lujan Grisham's resolution to offer pathways to citizenship for Dreamers. Nicole Chavez\nU.S. Senator Enrisa Lujan Grisham joined advocates, members of civil rights groups, advocates and children of Dreamer immigrants and their supporters across the county Monday to defend a congressional effort to protect young immigrants brought to the country illegally by their parents.\nLujan Grisham, D- NM, introduced legislation last year that would translate special Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) protections for 500,000 people brought to the U.S. illegally as children. It remains stalled in the Senate, as lawmakers debate whether to create a permanent solution for the kids who were brought to the country as children and who have not been convicted of a crime or are otherwise anti-social.\nOn Monday in Van Nuys, Caricao Carmona, a University of New Mexico political science professor and activist, was joined by her 8-year-old daughter Mia and her 12-year-old son Jackson at a rally to rally to protect Dreamers.\n\"Dreamers have been part of my entire existence,\" said Carmona, 29, who is an immigration researcher. \"As a mom, when I was a kid, my parents came to America from Mexico. I was born in California and my parents came from the Dominican Republic. This is who we are. This is who I am. This is the reality.\"\nCaraveo Carmona said the child image that accompanied her calls at the rally carried with them the memories of the children she had met growing up in San Diego.\n\"I don't think they understand what they've done to America.

Turnbull said in a statement.\n\"Like an aged care home, the gains promised by this deal mean today's retirees cannot afford to return to the NBN.\"\nThe deal is the subsidiary of Telstra that collects NBN Co bills and will now prevent non-Band 31 customers \u2013 about one million Australians \u2013 from avoiding getting shut off from infrastructure.\nIn a statement, NBN Co did not back away from details announced in the joint statement to the media today.\nThe company said the deal, under which it raised the lowest wholesale data rates, would impact some smaller NBN Co customers.\nAccording to NBN Co's statement, the discounts it offers to almost all customers will save customers ranging from $300 a year to $400 a year, with losses to both Telstra and NBN Co eventually falling to a minimum of $130.\nTiming of the deal is also to some extent swayed by a looming Australian government review.\nWhen exactly that review was announced has yet to be disclosed.\nTurnbull said Labor's policy on privatisation would have been a faster and cheaper process, with the Labor NBN would have rolled out fibre to every household within five years.\nBut there was no official mention of this in NBN Co's announcement today.\nInstead, Labor said the plan would rely on creating a secondbuild network that generally served existing customers in places left out of the auction, and it would have focused on connecting Australians to the fibre-to-the node at speeds that carried them higher and faster.\n\"It's clear that today's deal will ensure outside

This was the third-highest yearwide sales volume in the 20-year history of the National Association of Realtors\u00ae (NAR) housing market indicator. However, February\u2019s average sale price increased year over year by just 1.21%, climbing to $166,774.\n\nFebruary\u2019s average sales price increased annually by 1.06%. It reached $206,653, its highest February since $206,198 in August 2010.\n\nCompared to the first two months, February\u2019s sales increase of 0.64% in sales volume offers some good news as it marked the third consecutive monthly increase year over year. Underlying the recent gains are slower prices moves over the same period. Over the last 12 months, the number of homes sold has risen faster than the average sales price. Average sold prices were up 3.19% compared to a year ago, to $201,470, while the number of homes sold under $250,000 rose 5.92% to 25,673. The first quarter\u2019s average sales price also rose more than 2% to a record $219,406 \u2013 the fourth consecutive quarter that the median price\u2019s yearly growth has surpassed 3%.

The bills\u2019 second phase could help to raise wages for many independent restaurants with at least 200 locations.\n\nThe bill also includes coaxing those franchisees who want low wage workers out of the industry altogether to comply with their law of labor relations. And it would eliminate the requirement that large franchises (many with hundreds of locations) offer employees paid sick leave.\n\nThe studies also caught the attention of McDonald\u2019s, which was recently dealt a blow by Jamelle Bouie in a New Yorker piece that revealed that the company was \u201cBeyond the 5-Hour Day,\u201d voluntarily turning down outside vendors that offered its employees a \u201csecret pricing\u201d policy that allowed them to work longer hours because of the weak profit margins (interestingly, the \u201csecret pricing\u201d policy existed"}, {"prompt": "</s>Readers may be familiar with the fundamental changes that took place in the Roman world as it converted from paganism to Christianity in the fourth century, and as its emperors sought to govern, through the turbulent times of the fifth to seventh centuries,", "gen_tokens": [7733, 2313, 11, 63, 20090, 578, 102, 5448, 3569, 6, 4935, 609, 61, 21812, 17756, 775, 4, 1740, 5, 13342, 498, 6, 89, 2551, 410, 36849, 227, 2197, 8, 331, 4, 50118, 50118, 1708, 89, 58, 202, 9549, 14, 747, 2622, 27801, 8, 9655, 4, 1698, 4138, 9314, 6, 5, 940, 1038, 9, 2203, 6, 13412, 8, 1412, 9282, 13, 5, 2197, 11, 103, 1200, 4, 7411, 42, 21, 9327, 53, 23, 97, 498, 350, 747, 24, 21, 31683, 4, 1648, 624, 5, 2027, 2197, 5, 709, 9, 42, 3050, 21, 460, 2171, 6, 8, 144, 851, 24, 10, 205, 432, 9, 86, 25, 157, 25, 1007, 4, 50118, 50118, 1121, 5, 78, 4327, 5951, 405, 3629, 8, 167, 144, 2509, 11, 31017, 8952, 8, 10584, 5, 7733, 11492, 362, 2093, 9, 1455, 559, 2757, 6, 58, 441, 7, 14958, 14863, 19783, 227, 50118, 50118, 11970, 8, 17116, 9, 5, 4284, 7, 49, 308, 2093, 4, 7411, 42, 1756, 1595, 159, 149, 5, 6808, 8, 42, 1714, 456, 4, 286, 1246, 6, 1142, 9, 21878, 1986, 8, 2969, 5, 169, 9, 301, 8, 5, 8540, 592, 3115, 61, 4829, 5, 301, 8, 6010, 9, 5, 15167, 6, 4829, 588, 1272, 7, 28, 2312, 6, 53, 5, 15843, 156, 686, 743, 8941, 7, 5, 911, 2273, 6, 794, 648, 410, 50, 1085, 7, 109, 19, 2302, 4, 50118, 50118, 133, 8533, 9, 743, 222, 45, 1323, 4, 96, 498, 9, 670, 12294, 8, 11307, 5951, 405, 3629, 223, 5, 28899, 9, 5, 2197, 6, 50, 20303, 6, 74, 456, 486, 13, 41, 2432, 25598, 1280, 9, 4284, 7, 28, 4159, 30, 5, 16627, 4, 20, 2197, 44171, 1051, 10, 1307, 346, 9, 82, 111, 6272, 31, 5, 299, 45007, 29, 7, 5, 4477, 82, 9, 349, 976, 111, 7, 258, 1089, 8, 3453, 2841, 33836, 503, 7, 1306, 14, 1736, 1212, 1449, 1145, 1402, 8608, 4, 50118, 50118, 2709, 1246, 5, 8952, 7, 28, 4159, 11, 5, 33830, 11492, 11, 61, 89, 32, 202, 27958, 9, 221, 1951, 179, 8, 20749, 27284, 36, 2137, 212, 19649, 30, 34446, 27284, 43, 5585, 25965, 911, 111, 8, 42, 95, 137, 5, 34446, 27284, 6699, 5, 16605, 4361, 19, 63, 41082, 4, 6007, 6609, 8, 1377, 9, 42, 2345, 58, 25481, 19, 9282, 4, 20, 45560, 8, 2841, 46220, 6, 7, 1744, 49, 461, 8, 49, 4284, 6, 74, 2142, 171, 2732, 7, 5, 2803, 9, 1771, 8, 16659, 1080, 7, 10146, 710, 19, 8, 1091, 3489, 11, 5976, 9, 5, 1449, 3147, 15, 781, 2339, 4, 50118, 50118, 713, 460, 669, 7, 5, 2772, 9, 10, 4714, 346, 9, 16224, 2696, 6, 8204, 17626, 30, 5, 168, 9, 5, 36179, 6, 61, 58, 450, 25, 7053, 8, 542, 35844, 6, 20499, 9, 1111, 751, 1038, 659, 11, 1212, 8, 1038, 10794, 6, 19, 129, 1476, 6373, 15, 4137, 9, 5, 1226, 4, 85, 17, 27, 29, 1202, 7, 192, 141, 5859, 1111, 4106, 43011, 4904, 1111, 1986, 8, 714, 4, 318, 932, 77], "output": "</s>Readers may be familiar with the fundamental changes that took place in the Roman world as it converted from paganism to Christianity in the fourth century, and as its emperors sought to govern, through the turbulent times of the fifth to seventh centuries, Roman society in its entirety\u2014a methodical, extensive process which amassed definitive results. From the earliest times, there seemed little inconsistency between Church and State.\n\nBut there were still conflicts that often produced bloodshed and confusion. Progenitors, the private property of owners, existed and created difficulties for the Church in some cases. Sometimes this was unfortunate but at other times too often it was suppressed. Even within the Western Church the development of this conflict was always active, and most gave it a good deal of time as well as energy.\n\nIn the first instance agitators and those most interested in sacrificing lands and establishing the Roman Empire took advantage of present political division, were able to exploit dissensions between\n\npeople and tribes of the territory to their own advantage. Sometimes this opposition passed down through the generations and this changed again. For example, questions of colony policies and understanding the way of life and the subsidiary social relations which formed the life and organisation of the empire, formed real problems to be managed, but the priests made sure issues relating to the areas concerned, saw yet little or nothing to do with politics.\n\nThe bulk of issues did not pass. In times of strong ambitions and invasion agitators under the guise of the Church, or monarch, would again call for an undetermined amount of territory to be granted by the pope. The Church ALWAYS sent a huge number of people - ranging from the top hierarchs to the lay people of each region - to both British and Spanish emigration officials to ensure that individual land claims met certain criteria.\n\nFor example the lands to be granted in the Mandarin Empire in which there are still fragments of Pekin and Tang dynasty (overthrown by Qing dynasty) contain sizeable areas - and this just before the Qing dynasty touched the colonial powers with its claws. Control structures and projects of this sort were fraught with difficulties. The nobility and emperors, to protect their court and their territory, would send many supporters to the Ministry of War and Imperial Council to concur with and remain generally in favour of the claims listed on official documents.\n\nThis always led to the appearance of a vast number of charters, lists crafted by the government of the emperor, which were seen as peaceful and unaggressive, approving of Chinese outside property rights in land and property disputes, with only violence observed on behalf of the nation. It\u2019s difficult to see how widespread Chinese cultural karma upset Chinese policies and policy.

When the flu-vaccine manufacturer says their vaccine is 100% effective at preventing serious illness, the likelihood that you will become sick from infections received at the same time as you are immunized is increased.\nThe qualities that make people more susceptible to infection are:\nBeing in direct contact with the sick person; Exposure to respiratory droplets that have been expelled by the sick person; or Exposure to the droplet while the temperatures of the sick person and the people in close contact with the infected person climb.\nCloth face masks tend to decrease the transmission of airborne droplets; avoiding questions about wearing them properly; And, not washing your hands.\nEveryone needs to be aware that the risk of an infection if you spend 10 minutes in a room with someone who has had the flu is not zero, but yet it is usually low. And, while you are not at risk to die from the flu, your loved ones will be at risk to get sick from it.

During his captivity on\nVannes Island, emperor Frederick II allowed three Neapolitan nobles to remain at the island. Vincenzo, equipped mostly with questions he learned from Marie de Medici (1473\u20131536), was able to visit Constantinople (now Istanbul) by ship. There he became the court theologian.

Newman and Glick patented a unique kerf profile that accounts for the shape of each cue ball and helps you find a\nsqueeze point for maximum accuracy?even if your cue ball shape is unnaturally warped. Plus, Quaker State offers best-in-class durability.\n\nSimple, Rich Duty\nIf you feel well when you schlep it to the first tee, playing the golf surface under your feet makes life easier, elongates the season and gets you fired up in no time. For smooth, flat play, the polyurethane-coated polymer layer reduces friction\nwhile enhancing durability.\n\nUpdate\nadding decks to our product series would come at a price more than the equivalent re-creation of the softball category. We really think that to have an updated product series is ripping off customers. We\nmarket PADS to amateurs and professionals and have a greater understanding of players. We make copiers and promote 'amateur-quality' players, coaxing those capable of creating and practicing play to do\nit on a professional level. So with that, to us, it makes really no sense to add players who are still working on their game.\n\nDave Glick says The Stroke Guide tennis players should use\ntophanders, smashes, returners and serves) along with spacing etc. To develop the game faster and harder.

His convoluted plan to oust his adversaries from power with hollow democratic speeches and sham democracy did not have a viable likelihood of success. He suppressed the country\u2019s legitimate opposition leader Leopoldo Lopez and the national security gave it that green light to take action against him for alleged anti-government activity. If history has taught us anything it is that dictators die. Chavez the father of modern democracy in his country Venezuela never died. At best he slipped on his Venezuelan throne and never regained it.\nOn three occasions over the past two decades, the military \u2013 and one senior opposition politician \u2013 Leopoldo Lopez attempted to challenge the way Chavez was ruling the subsidiary state of the socialist economic empire in the Western Hemisphere known as Venezuela. In 2004, Chavez chased him out of his Kiev Palace presidential penthouse, for attempting to yet again try and bring an end to his corrupt reign. In 2012 when Rodriguez was first elected Vice-President, he resulted in the Guaido under his charge disbanding the Bolivarian army. He was accused of being involved in plotting coups. He was also accused of violently detumbing his critics in 2004.\nEven after the death on 29th February 2018, Chavez refused to transition power to his fellow left wing politician and eventually the Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, citing the need to preserve Venezuela from destabilization.\nThese attempts by the Venezuelan opposition in which no success is recorded ever parted the stave Maduro\u2019s dictatorship. Any movement to seize power from usconcr sack-of-shite right wing politician Mr Trump who ran on a platform of America First or national sovereignty is met with the horrendous reprisals of war to protect the corrupt and increasingly assertive slaves who have built this regime and the region for decades.\nAny democratic country should remain agnostic to this regime and its term of rule.

Especially when the world is staring down the barrel of increasingly assertive depletion due to runaway emissions and an undependable global economy.\nThe World Wildlife Fund generally estimates rising sea levels to account for between 1 and 3% of the world's coral by 2100, with bleaching itself accounting for about 1.5%.

There is a definite difference between ADHD and ADHD efferent neuropathway disorders, e.g., depression, mania, and deep-seated depression disorders. Efferent neuropathways in the cortex of the brain have been clearly identified as important in higher order cognitive functioning, e.g., recognition, computation, presentation of a sensory stimuli, or authorization/consent. Under normal conditions the circuits involved in memory recall are active, and at particular points the ammongiate gaze focus desensitizes these qualities, that memory is temporarily blocked, and the optimal action is direct attention. Controlled attention is then possible; being able to complete the goal after the action has been initiated allows the work to be valuable. Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder is not, however, a specific cue to inhibit the prefrontal memory.\u201d Further, \u201cCAFOD subtypes differ in terms of personality questions. The main difference is the way CAFs act. Brain activation during the CAFs are in the negative domains, e.g., to affect the procedural goals of processing information; avoiding getting strategies to overcome conflicts, e.g., the process of decision analysis; attention regulation, e.g., schizoid bipolar-truly bipolar individuals demonstrate gainful information processing and tuning strategies.\u201d\n\nFrom The Neuroscience Network: \u201cEmotional dysregulation may underlie hyperactivity / impulsivity / impulsivity-like behaviors.

You're no longer just a Hart. Can you take that over?' You have to grab the genie with the fiddle, and stop telling everybody what Hogan did or what Undertaker did. They liked that, to be able to say: 'You know what, I was still me, and now I'm going to be World Champion again.' And they're not going to do it if you tell them it's The Undertaker after Bryan's got his image mapped out, or John Cena after AJ Lee has gotten her picture mapped out. You have to leave something for the subsidiary outside characters to do.\"\nBischoff also weighed in on character building tendencies of wrestlers.

Kevin Kelly studied with you, and the PR push that you were so successful with would really worry many of the graduates I speak with now. I see you mostly as the 'greatest generation' of tech advisors, and if you want people to take you seriously, I would suggest you prevent this impression.\nQuite frankly, if the lessons you're suggesting are strategies to overcome infrastructure limitations you don't really care bout an audience that probably isn't interested in knowledge to build a single-loop mailtruck to help enable the USPS, under which I'd venture the Internet really is the network impact distributor of all the services you do have valued. I also tend to shy away from the idea of marketing consensus. Why would I want to use a solution that doesn't deliver the solution to my neighbors, local businesses, and friends?\nIf your connections with local constituents are the ones that let you write the grants to your favorite charities, I feel sorry for you. We're supposed to value this because it allows us to help people whose communities are hurting. We value community and making things 'better'. Why are the geniuses coaxing those capable of creating and sustaining communities this generation not cultivating networks that allow them to help distribute that same energy? Are you even really working with victims you're trying to 'help'?\nYou can toss around concensusbuild and sentiment platform, sales-by-mail and feeling _'found'_ in the community (I'm actually really glad that you mentioned this phenomena at conference), but really, this may be the major point of local marketing in terms of opportunity? What exactly are you offering your community that you actually care about sharing? Do you really need karma points and performance metrics?

In contrast to our dominance in sports, African-American men make up less than 5 percent of all males enrolled in medical school. A recent report from the Association of American Medical Colleges highlights that there actually was a 20 percent decline for black male doctors from 2001 to 2011.\n\nBut there\u2019s another side. One that affirms that wellness and not lack of talent determines who makes it in medicine.\n\nAs more and more sports figures, including African-American athletes, are speaking out about health and fitness, kicking off their careers at age 20 or 22 or 25, psychiatrists today are stressing the importance of pursuing \u201cwellness\u201d as a lifestyle and a business model. athletes that simply follow through on their training, nutrition and lifestyle understand that success in the agasint adds more than just achievement to their careers and the sport itself.\n\nIn 2008, Olympic gymnast Simone Biles studied personal training while she was in high school. She wanted to learn how an athlete felt and what fitness gains she experienced that changed her outlook. Her yearlong research became the basis of her foundation, BilesRx, a non-profit that provides resources and information to prevent and treat mental and physical health problems. She furthered her sponsorship deal with MasterCard for 2012 to yet inspire others to make an ideal lifestyle their business.\n\nOther legendary athletes have been making it a priority to promote wellbeing. Marcus Guyer, a former Major League Baseball player who had 300,000 devoted soccer fans throughout his career, took a job in 2003 as the personal trainer for the St. Louis Cardinals. Guyer was the first on-field celebrity to endorse health and wellness services.\n\nOthers in their 20s or early 30s who\u2019ve made the transition into hospitalist practices see greater transparency and accountability in the moment-to-moment decision making expected in medicine. The Wolfson Health generallist to the Times was Dr. Cancon Kleventier, MD, an OB-GYN with Wolfson PopGenix and Madison Hill Medical Nutrition.\n\nIn addition, these health care professionals are also active members of health communities where they speak up on issues that affect them and their patients.\n\nSeeing firsthand the changing needs of patients and fans, athletes are consequently feeling the consequences of their own risky behaviors. Cancer survivors are frequently turning to image designers for inspiration. They have become increasingly insistent on being styled in more fashionably appropriate ways. There\u2019s outside pressure to resemble younger versions or revisit contact with the sport that began their careers.

This recognition will help us in our endeavour to make India a super-smart democracy,\" he added.The Paytm Kohlberg platform assists people to manage their Sage 85 consultation benefits to simplify and reduce manual processes and paperwork.Using that platform people can access healthcare benefits, for diagnostics, cancer screening and other agasintealth-related services from their smartphones and the app itself acts as a workstation for them.\"Awareness about the VAHAN platform is increasing all over the world. You'll be able to use the AI assistant to speak with doctors and get medication offers sent to the pharmacy, without downloads or jumping through hoops. Additionally, you can access basic healthcare services without having to open medical records, if you choose to,\" said Holman.Amelia's creators intend to use her for certain businesses yet to be disclosed such an entity will help their users access bulk data to provide personalised recommendations.Instead of putting in cash at the hospital, under this new model patients like the ones on the platform would be made to pay in the form of a VAHA coin, which the patient can collect in a kiosk. The VAHA coin would be a blockchain-based token which would be used to facilitate both purchase and billing of healthcare services rendered by doctors affiliated with VAHA.The compassionate category hospital -- VAHA grants to patients who have joined a VAHA Premier Partner are expected to range from Rs 800 to Rs 25,000 per year. Through this platform patient's Cancon and Metrotier 's data can be accessed for free with the patients also getting free consultations and medical advice.While it would be great if these cryptocurrencies became a feasible future payment option, VAHA coins have yet to be incorporated as one of the six cryptocurrencies that will be seen on the platform according to Holman.</s>I have no feeling in my legs, it's terrifying.

Focus requires discipline and a certain level of mental toughness, meaning that you have developed the capacity to perform to the best of your ability despite external conditions or internal distractions. You can minimize distractions by keeping your focus close to the light source.\n\nA good guide to keeping your focus is to look at the light source from wherever you can. Sun rays will melt kale in the blink of an eye, but you can adjust the direction of the light in order to counteract that by shifting your position so that you can see most of the light but still be under the warm bright light.\n\nA clever little trick that a few runners have managed to stick with and master is to either simply lie down on the ground, with your back against a solid object (the main lesson here being to take care of yourself) or somewhere that is further away from work, school, and family. Note that the picture I used is the photo of the same location that YouTuber Max Rengo took the photo.\n\nFor those outdoors, it's completely useless to keep your jacket or gloves or shoes by the road, but it's worth noting that the same applies to head phones. Depending on the strength of your mind, you're more likely to hear things around you than yet another bruise on your already sliced wrist.\n\nThat can be done either through making it your habit to shut headphones at the end of workouts or tuning them down lowest possible. It makes more impact than a simple change in volume, and it's easy to tend to the damage yourself by changing from running music to music which is more distracting on a train / subway.\n\nBefore workouts, your visualizations are going to be more rosy than blue skies; that's the point of being out there and doing the whole thing. The moment that you step into an indoor room with cramped walls and wires and no running paths, your normal running routine melts away. Can you imagine making it all the way without coming in contact with coaxing those blasted headphones?\n\nIt's also worth noting that playing music off an external source (i.e. earbuds connected to a mobile) doesn't make for the most ethical audio streaming scenario. Probably not worse than generally playing music through other devices at home, but it's definitely not always the cleanest option. If you're taking a journey, you're probably going to be pushing and being pushed to the point of fatigue, but you may still be outside longer than in your usual workouts.\n\nWhen you're on the move, keep an eye out for hazards too.
