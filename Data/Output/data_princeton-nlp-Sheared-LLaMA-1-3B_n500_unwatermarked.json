The board voted Saturday afternoon not to, but a group of individuals and Crystal City businesses did succeed in halting the vote.\nWill people from all across the region attend the hearing?\nNo one was sure. Some Norther Virginia residents who appeared showed up when it was time to talk. At least 20 showed up in Crystal City. The hope is there will be a hemorrhaging of Crystal City\u2019s existing businesses, many of which will be most affected by an Amazon chill. Clean-up crews surrounding the buildings that are to be razed will have emergency equipment flown in.\nWhat about at Amazon\u2019s current Crystal City headquarters?\nVirginia Beach is the favorite among regular Amazon residents. Arlington County held a hearing in August 2017 and opposed its own development plan, and -- at the last minute -- Athena\u2019s Grove residents stopped it. In May, when a county supervisor presented its development plan, only 100 people attended in favor. Most were southern Virginia residents in canvassing positions and out paid the Athena\u2019s Grove residents.\nLocal advocates speculate this means that those supporting development of another headquarters may be out of luck and that Amazon is playing a strong game.

At 52 percent, Charles and Camilla had the backing of 35 percent of the poll respondents.\nAlthough less than a third thought the Queen was the best parent for her children, 25 percent named Charles or Camilla as best, followed by Charles\u2019 sister, the Duchess of Cornwall (21 percent). Thankfully, another 13 percent chose Sarah Ferguson, who came in fifth.\nFact #1: In a Long Branch, New Jersey, hotel when bridesmaid Harry and Meghan Markle were born, Meghan learned more (but not less) than Charles.\nNext, interesting fact: Only 24 percent thought the Queen was the best parent for her children, yet she won 43 percent of the vote in our poll.\nFact #2: Charles and Camilla were most likely to substitute or substitute-assist break the top two.\nFact #3: Prince William got somewhere between third place and sixth place.\nPrince Harry may be able to \u201cride like the wind\u201d but in our poll, Prince Harry and Meghan Markle fell slightly short of the top two parents.\nFact #4: Prince William got between sixth and 13th place.\nFact #5: Prince Harry may be the best gadget-crazy parent, but Queen Elizabeth is number one when it comes to tablets.\nFact #6: Queen Elizabeth has every internet-related subscriber assigned to one person, with seven being assigned to her son Prince Philip and four being assigned to her in-laws Prince Andrew and the Duchess of York.

There is something that people are going to be suffering from, but I still don\u2019t know whether it is a public health or a public relations nightmare. It is going to completely unsettle the nation at least. It can conjure up some very, very nasty ideas about us.

There should never be a virus with so-called higher probability of zero transmission face of infecting us, nor a disease with higher probability of zero public relations.\nWhat do we in the U.S. continuously put the red car as we talk about?\nThe red car roadway that that means \u2013 we really accept that our country as an entire phenomenon comes to us with its unintended consequence.

This also includes essentially all of the language implementation modules available in your operating system. These implementations are typically static libraries in C or Unix. In general, you should use an internal IEEE standard component implementation of a regular expression to break out logic that is needed specifically for your specifying the matching parts of the construct. If your language's implementation doesn't have the required implementation, you'll usually need to write the implementation yourself. The problem with this when working with programs that know theirs is that it usually requires a custom implementation from scratch. The same applies to documentation explaining how to do this language's regular expressions with each of its mechanisms.\nIf, on the other hand, you have a base class you can reuse repeatedly, you may want to allow yourself in some implementing rules a built-in interface or one based on methods and return values. If you use procedures and functions provided by the component in these (for this call continuation \"procedures as functions\" pattern), you can make very compact documentation that can be used in many different systems while still providing the functionality.\nAs a complication to this, each element of the argument that is not regular expression in C/Unix can be replaced with another regular expression.

Is that something that you\u2019ve grappled with or had hand in your effort? Carlos Montaner: I think I hemmed and hawealdos people\u2019s hands, but not hand-wringing for some reason somewhere in there.We think we have the TIPS committee doing their part to put the information out there emergency decisions more in the left-of-center universe in this county, then we have it here. We have lectures tonight, regular meetings.We\u2019ve never held a regular meeting when we were putting this together. That was part of what happened very early on. Had that not happened, then I think we still would be. In terms of pushing for more voter education, you can go back to this starting push. We had a couple small iterations of that.The canvassing is very, very important. In the IE [Initiative], 80 percent of the people who voted no on initiatives on the ballot this year did not know anybody else had voted. The ballot explained for that 15 percent who did not know that the initiatives voted no on that year did not need to be brought up to that 15 percent. Next year, we\u2019re gonna canvass the whole county we\u2019re gonna be at each of our precincts every single day. Keep people in the loop. Reinforce the education teams, that\u2019s very important. We try to go every precinct. We do five or six precinct. Most of them accomplish that but they drift. They keep missing dates in between and nobody notices continuity. We\u2019ve been incredibly lucky doing this. Tonight Andrew [Johnson] brought through voters from the same election. We spend a lot of time going out, each and every time, that we\u2019re here after CASA [Community Alliance for Social Action]. Dr. Joseph will explain what he\u2019s doing.

Apple's stock price has climbed from a little over $5 in December 1996 to more than $350 this month and it's still going higher.\nThe reason why is, all that is going after your cash flow is the ultimate Mac now that there is so much money going into this section.\nThe reason why investors paid so much for this right now is because of the number of categories in Apple that contributed to the growth.\nHere's two examples. iPhones have gone from devices like your old black cellphone that cost you $130Syntax to $450 or more at the top end. Mac sales are following along behind.\nEven yesterday, Microsoft did a conference call about its own shipments of PCs and clarified some mispricing that people have. Let's just call it mispricing in the hobbyist category emerged and was more in the top-of-the-pyramid range then.\nCorrections - But take them away even then and you can afford a nice enough iMac.\nThe factories were idle for a while and Apple has raised prices a bit -- which generate more cash so that the low prices -- they did repeat. $1,999 Mac things that could be had when you bought an iPhone.\nBut when you were buying the same type of Mac product you had two choices, paid the same price for it or bought it -- or thought you were buying an iPhone that looked like an iMac but then you got one or put time in your budget.\nYou know, that's that's all the world is is making is the Mac is the MacBook that costs $1,999. If you sell it, you have to ship from China and what are your options for explaining how you created this artificial market?

Once sacrosanct Hippocratic Oath has been obscured by the British Medical Association, we have no more illusions that we will have any opportunities to protect our ultimate agency when we dictate standards to individual medical practitioners. The difficulty, of course, is not simply that the BMA has zero oversight and inappropriate pressures from government and industry; the significant nature of self-regulation (as with respect to pharmacists) is still astonishing to some observers.\nOur concern here is in the way the national standard for doctors has been in hemorrhage over the years namely the issue of disclosure of clinical spinal anomalies (CSAs) by so many doctors. Tens of thousands of their patients (the majority of whom have emergency decisions to make) have been left at the mercy of some doctors who have decided to mislead about them. In this regular revictimization is also an unprecedented treatment inconsistency that we doctors have to face. There is something that needs to be said so that the issue will not fester.\nIt may well be that some of those doctors have had specific CSA but this is not completely untrue. Most doctors have not made an effort to see if and whether a patient of an adjacent organ or having of a CSA has received life-saving drugs.\nThe substantial refusal of doctors and spinal surgeons to alert their colleagues about the possibility of CSAs betrays a double standard. It is tantamount to saying doctors are more concerned about the influence of organized capitalism here because a lamb from the profession has been born this year. The fundamental principle we ought to be addressing is \u2018do no harm.\u2019 Doctors have been habituated to tell potential CSAs when they have no serious risk. There is no shortage of people happily buying things with no risk or with very big.

Can you please stop throwing blood all over me, Sega? Oh god, it's in my mouth.\nSega's Rise of Nightmares is basically a Mummy movie with a children's game going after your cash. An old record with haunting chiptunes plays over the game with haunted children all over, decked out in decorations from Halloween. It's not that the idea is all that new or all that original; EA's Fallout 4 used similar devices to chase eggs in this game. Honestly, it's the most aggressively pretentious title Sega has released for the console system. I hemmed and hawed trying to justify the purchase cost; it's possible that words can sum it up somewhere but I can't take credit for Tyrantis' comment in the comments of the last article. Basically, I came in with my hip fracture guard in hand, tried everything in the manual to no avail (I can't throw regular shot glasses this is for an adult), and though when it first came out we decided to just have two adults and one child sit there (but were still reminded to \"be polite\"), it's clearly recommended for things like that.\nThe only consolation is that if you buy this, I don't think you can get 20+ hours out of it.\nThis game likely wouldn't win an Oscars for atmosphere or sound design.\nWhat? No more groaning and screaming?\nOh what the hell, I'll actually do it since it's been a while. I have all the Bloodhunt parts and Carlos can handle that while we finish it here.\nHoly shit, what are those?\nWhile we're at it, let's get the haunted clown's shoes off first...\nStill I can't believe that we got through this with so few deaths, mostly due to face stealing or one person's stupidity.

It happened about a decade ago, when she was 23.\nNext, she learned that someone she knew at work also had haemophilia. Shortly before, she gave blood.\n\u201cI am now past 12 1/2 years without bleeding in the veins and as I drove 80 miles home this morning, I released all of it on the ground, somewhere in Augusta,\u201d Leos said.\nHaving leukemia that made her fragile meant that she needed a donor\u2019s blood for her doctors to put into drugs.\n\u201cWhen I got to her front desk, I told her that this would once again allow her to take part in the healing power of Tommorow\u2019s blood. I would come when it was time I had her back,\u201d Greer said.\nStill, in the weeks before the blood drive, Greer was nervous. Most of the people making blood donations are regulars at St. Martin\u2019s, not volunteers. In the past, she has hosted donor drives there. Tonight\u2019s will be at Tradepoint Baltimore II, a Centerpoint development by the Johns Hopkins Hospital.\nOn Wednesday, when Leos entered the drive, she knew exactly who Greer was.\n\u201cI had the pleasure of being named on Facebook, I looked and saw"}, {"prompt": "<s> But why will this bailout work when an earlier one failed and has Greece now surrendered control of its own economy?\nAfter more than 14 hours of negotiations in Brussels an agreement has been reached on a rescue package", "gen_tokens": [7088, 395, 29896, 29947, 29929, 29889, 29945, 11197, 3704, 263, 2553, 29873, 2436, 1283, 363, 25549, 541, 278, 29754, 9242, 297, 278, 4902, 411, 1784, 1286, 1852, 26420, 363, 278, 28744, 310, 278, 4234, 30010, 29879, 28396, 2553, 29873, 6866, 1145, 29889, 2811, 372, 367, 674, 372, 367, 1554, 393, 338, 297, 278, 10261, 30010, 29879, 322, 278, 7824, 7761, 313, 29923, 29965, 29897, 10916, 30010, 4066, 310, 1316, 7282, 5469, 29973, 13, 1576, 10261, 471, 9701, 297, 278, 25012, 310, 278, 27889, 607, 338, 278, 3619, 27550, 363, 278, 7824, 7761, 408, 278, 2323, 27550, 607, 27849, 278, 8469, 29879, 297, 278, 937, 10742, 310, 278, 9475, 583, 541, 756, 5229, 297, 278, 302, 10157, 583, 322, 10081, 29899, 4102, 6462, 471, 263, 766, 1901, 363, 278, 10916, 393, 892, 760, 310, 372, 8236, 304, 278, 10261, 10124, 372, 29889, 13, 1576, 15151, 29906, 29900, 29900, 11197, 498, 905, 261, 3152, 310, 278, 29871, 29947, 29900, 11176, 14703, 322, 278, 901, 7786, 697, 505, 5331, 304, 5717, 363, 14933, 297, 445, 24161, 304, 337, 386, 682, 372, 394, 1516, 8686, 1446, 297, 278, 16741, 583, 746, 4943, 6664, 919, 29884, 27855, 338, 3307, 363, 502, 304, 1065, 278, 4234, 1532, 3307, 304, 505, 263, 9045, 29891, 2834, 29889, 12884, 293, 322, 5264, 4828, 4225, 304, 367, 18764, 287, 577, 393, 278, 4234, 674, 451, 1603, 367, 337, 4939, 515, 278, 1400, 29899, 386, 905, 261, 3785, 2553, 29873, 24161, 3643, 278, 29871, 29906, 29900, 29900, 29947, 26504, 6446, 297, 260, 271, 2153, 29889, 13, 6028, 591, 21750, 508, 591, 1584, 1074, 7684, 322, 13283, 12530, 363, 310, 599, 278, 288, 25101, 2534, 304, 23764, 24941, 542, 1038, 15942, 29973, 2193, 445, 338, 393, 338, 4312, 304, 2329, 372, 29973, 18269, 763, 16427, 393, 864, 3386, 3598, 363, 599, 263, 3533, 2108, 616, 22856, 363, 502, 599, 363, 393, 12623, 30010, 29879, 7088, 310, 664, 338, 3907, 372, 2411, 1461, 936, 363, 599, 363, 393, 12623, 30010, 29879, 817, 304, 367, 6296, 701, 304, 2635, 29973, 1938, 591, 817, 263, 8084, 8649, 291, 29973, 13, 1576, 5745, 7572, 445, 7250, 24232, 920, 25549, 674, 591, 674, 367, 22964, 3276, 363, 599, 363, 1176, 800, 29889, 1334, 505, 1286, 750, 7458, 1156, 7458, 541, 1286, 746, 372, 338, 931, 306, 626, 5429, 694, 901, 1048, 278, 2446, 12623, 470, 278, 2446, 12623, 297, 278, 716, 1176, 800, 3447, 304, 367, 6345, 674, 367, 12530, 363, 29889, 7849, 310, 599, 372, 2444, 591, 674, 1286, 367, 5146, 292, 6909, 1286, 577, 297, 825, 1781, 10847, 437, 591, 3133, 5794, 1925, 278, 6909, 7113, 408, 591, 2609, 4078, 445, 716, 3533, 2108, 616, 12623, 29973, 13, 9526, 5684, 766, 25071, 1549, 445, 7234, 338, 393, 278, 11118, 7113, 263, 716, 16493, 338, 626, 9564, 314, 630, 304, 1269, 4234, 29889, 739, 674, 367, 5528, 1038, 292, 17202, 1156, 17202, 515, 1422, 10916, 541, 372, 674, 367, 1790, 12502, 29881, 4331, 310, 278, 8938, 280, 1623, 29889, 450, 3186, 26504, 1033, 3438, 1048, 29871], "output": "<s> But why will this bailout work when an earlier one failed and has Greece now surrendered control of its own economy?\nAfter more than 14 hours of negotiations in Brussels an agreement has been reached on a rescue package worth $189.5bn including a debt write off for Greece but the devil remains in the details with many now arguing for the removal of the country\u2019s giant debt burden. Will it be will it be something that is in the UK\u2019s and the European Union (EU) countries\u2019 interest of such significant nature?\nThe UK was involved in the establishment of the euro which is the common currency for the European Union as the single currency which enjoyed the proceeds in the first wave of the eighties but has failed in the nineties and twenty-first century was a disaster for the countries that were part of it leading to the UK leaving it.\nThe \u00a3200bn Thatcher era of the 80 emergency and the more recent one have led to calls for Britain in this crisis to rethink it alms defeats in the seventies when regular revictualling is enough for us to run the country well enough to have a healthy life. Economic and social problems needs to be reversed so that the country will not still be reborn from the post-thatcher period debt crisis nor the 2008 economy completely in tatters.\nCan we afford can we even see gold and silver paid for of all the oasis having to substitute cryptocurrencies?

Do we need a Next Million?\nThe media continued this morning explaining how Greece will we will be diminished for all for generations. We have now had trouble after trouble but now when it is time I am told no more about the next generation or the next generation in the new generations yet to be born will be paid for.

Moreover, the case against President Nicolas Maduro is much more serious and inappropriate.\nThe charges were pretexts to justify Venezuelan dictatorship. With respect to coking, Mr. Chavez ruled that no one owned the right to coking coal at the top of the national congress. For a country in hemisphere run by a communist dictatorship, that principle is fairly spacious for some democratic institutions.\nMembers of the opposition were also condemned to death for hindering the economy by demanding the end of Venezuela\u2019s \u201csocialism\u201d in 2014 and blocking alms at churches. The verdicts against the opposition members were fake enough that there were no critical press or government programs following the trials.\nThe president, conversely, learned hard lessons from his crowdization. Mr. Chavez exacted harsh retribution on those criticizing his government, who were pilloried as completely un-Venecular and brainwashed.\nIt is not out of the question that Mr. Maduro's government thought that the outlier opposition was that flawed. The arrest on accusations of embezzlement and electoral fraud would ordinarily be the pursuit of a cemetery-aggregation in Venezuela.\nChavez\u2019s fate was guarded, but the influence of his political convictions have weakened from disproportionately supporting the once-commensurable Bolsonaro instead of seeking legal reforms. Chavez's habits distracted from real social progress in education, healthcare and regulation. Given Venezuela\u2019s higher standards, it is only appropriate that Maduro\u2019s. Most Venezuelans are unaware of Chavez\u2019s effective inefficiency because they continuously decided the leftist as an average commonsense leader.\nRegional lack of attention also brought through Maduro's anticorruption offensive. Maduro focused on the Keystone task of finishing the construction of thousands of CASA-esque panochs.

adopted and in use by all the UK\u2019s health services by September 2016 there was a risk that the NHS could face disruption when still tens of thousands of outdated PCs are redundantly written-off

\u00a31200 a year to put the information into safe emergency storage.\nThe hospital network, including at London\u2019s two Royal Infirmary hospitals, sees nearly 15 million visits a year \u2013 a staggering figure, and critical when trusts simply have to do their \u201cfundamentals\u201d.\nDr Luke Thompson, professor of emergency medicine at Edinburgh University said: \u201cThis is a

The small things you do to lower costs and increase output can be the difference between a failing business and soaring profits. No matter how good your team members may be, it\u2019s not enough to have ambitious goals for your business. Here are five tips to implementing agile systems for your automated business.\nCreating shipping channels enables you to increase efficiency. Automated shipping uses web services to create an optical drive in each item that is easily identified and added to an order. Fully self-explanatory, the entire process is set up before the item is delivered. The software integrates data from the internet and retail stores in order to stock the product. For instance, automated shipping may opt to scan a code on a customer\u2019s handheld device. In some cases, businesses use a CPC or APH compatible neural network to classify items for the shipping process by searching for connected items in the network.\nOrganization is inevitable at this point and it makes your business easier to manage. You don\u2019t have to worry about finding an effective place to store things or tracking the quantity of inventory. Once you have a firm grasp on your inventory, you can spend more time advertising online or growing your business.\nYour inventory also includes items you buy from third-party vendors. Recently, I asked you how your past business can help you in your new automated business. In the sales team, you can offer a customer discount on an item that is purchased with a substantial refund. You don\u2019t need to send a paid customer back to your retail store that they placed an order on your site, but you can split the items for that customer when you need to.\nThese tips should do wonders for your automated business. With your continued focus on higher profit margins and zero mistreatment of each customer, you should be able to facilitate smooth distribution in the market.\nAutomation makes teams more efficient and can attend to the tasks that have higher value to you. An integral part of your process will need to employ automation in order to drastically increase output.\nAs you add new strategies continuously, you will have more time to devote to making sure customers keep their items that you supply.

However, some individuals had withdrawn from the Greater Penang Island (GPI), George Town Constituency (GTP) and Armenian Islands Constituency (GAP) constituencies for the Selangor State Legislative Assembly (SKL).\nAlso on Monday, the eight people shortlisted by the JSC for the post of people\u2019s representatives in the 9th Gebeng Municipal Council (GMC) were listed. JSC chairman Toh was in the chair in the proceedings.\nThe emergency decree came into force from 5pm yesterday (Oct 20) for Penang and 6am on Tuesday for regular sectors.\nJSC chairman Wee Jin Toh said yesterday that 18 shortlisted candidates had withdrawn their papers for the GAP constituency, due to their inability to make their nomination papers by 5pm yesterday.\nMeanwhile, he also stated that 8 were asked to withdraw their papers in the GPI constituency and 3 in the GTP constituency. \u201cNine people withdrawn their nomination papers\u201d, he added.\nThe GAP candidature had gone to the electoral commission (EC) for verification yesterday that a campaign meeting date could be made in place of the constituency meeting for GAP candidates on Jan 15.\n\u201cWhen we got confirmation from the EC last week, it said this would be the new campaign meeting instead of the earlier one at Hong Lim Park. We applied with EC.

Dr. Glashow, co-chief of sports medicine at Mount Sinai Medical Center, tells HollywoodLife.com exclusively the outlook for Kevin.\nWhen Kevin Weaver was first removed from the court due to knee pain, with Mount Sinai doctors determining the severity of his injury, his doctor, Dr. William Glashow, was fearful for his son\u2019s future. Glashow tells HollywoodLife.com exclusively that Kevin\u2019s struggle is not over.\nKevin Weaver played high school basketball when he was injured, and Glashow explains that it\u2019s likely he suffered a significant fracture. That is a hemarthrosis, a stress fracture of the extremity bone that\u2019s most common in skeletal structures, the moment the outer covering of surrounding bone splits. Glashow explains that emergency treatment was necessary in order to manage the knee\u2019s swelling, then subsequent treatment to remove rock fragments. But even after those procedures, Dr. Glashow warns that \u201cyour critical treatment\u2026is simply preventing further damage. Once that occurs, there\u2019s no coming back.\u201d Glashow explains that it\u2019s normal for a fractured bone kein also be essentially completely crushed.\nThe sports doctor explains completely that Kevin\u2019s situation is \u201cmajor,\u201d can potentially be fatal, and that a fracture can lead to having to substitute bone with adhesive materials to stay involved with his beloved Mount Sinai Blue Storm Men\u2019s Basketball team. The Report doesn\u2019t confirm whether that\u2019s what\u2019s going on in Kevin\u2019s case, and if that\u2019s the case, Glashow admits that it\u2019s a \u201clife or death\u201d situation.\nAs for once Kayvon retired as a player, even though he did stop playing basketball, Glashow confirms that people still call him \u201cKevbo\u201d \u2014 though that\u2019s not because the name-calling is worth it. Instead, the doctor explains, Kevin is known as \u201cKevbo\u201d because he is referred to as Kevin in games (he was not continuously decided as Kevin, as Kayvon was officially doing in the 2009-10 through 2011-12 seasons). Glashow says that it\u2019s a word that comes naturally to him, after Clemson football player Evan Engram came up with the nickname, then nicknamed his child Kevin, and that"}, {"prompt": "<s> A

Mechanical engineers break this task down by creating innovative ways on how to move an object without using power whereas a computer engineer would ordinarily design computers for that very purpose.\nIn terms of making a machine to do something, a hydraulic engineer creates solutions based on the way how machines usually work. Next, a structural engineer concentrates on how an object structurally works unlike an aerospace engineer who creates mechanisms that aeroplanes use but a part of it can also be used in a jet engine. If you wear a safety helmet everyday you probably face the risk of one day dying. Most employers of an engineers tend to rate their money. Their incentive to do well continuously put the business of the company at risk if doing well is very risky since that means disaster through imminent collapse of the entire phenomenon.

Cover by Jamal Campbell.\nMighty Morphin Power Rangers #5 manages to do a lot. It sets up new story threads and characters while answering ultra important questions that could dictate the outcome of the Mighty Morphin Power Rangers\u2019 future. It also helps that Ryan Reynolds and his Jonah Hill have come on board to direct and write the big screen spin-off film, there was a lot to like (much of this was the result of Thony Silas\u2019 cover art which enjoyed some serious recognition in the Power Rangers fan community following). With all that hemming and haweing, however, there was still one small jab that was kept for some reason somewhere in there.\nMighty Morphin Power Rangers #5 sees one of the biggest surprises of the Punisher\u2019s comic history: Up in Apocalypse World, it is learned that Walter Jones is not Warren Worthington, but a fake who poses as the century old sidekick power-master ever since he was abandoned by his Ranger friends. (Considering the low cover price for this, it is a small price to pay). Yet here in Civil War Earth-J, he pushes completely through, filling the Mighty Morphin Power Rangers\u2019 ranks to competition for the Power Rangers. It is now time for him to repay this debt by leading his former comrades to victory in the Mighty Morphin Power Rangers\u2019 showdown with that most powerful of the world\u2019s Rangers, Megazord.\nThere is a little more Carlos Acuna influence to his character than I had expected.\nWho is this Walter Jones? In the comic, he wears his diminutive physique and superhuman gadgetry as though he were a true part of the series I had been watching since about the second season or so. What made the new material seem even more of a stretch was the big decision made by Ryan Reynolds and his team to open the plot with Walter in a bunker city within continuity decidedly alien as we have encountered over these past three issues. While apparently not a direct return to villainy, this same level of phenomenon-magnetism seemed unintentionally furthered when the Publisher\u2019s Weekly describes it as being \u201cyour typical busybody villain of the weekside comics genre.\u201d Even the geographical locations"}, {"prompt": "<s> Florida Institute of Technology quarterback Brandon Ziarno.\nMELBOURNE, Fla. - Florida Institute of Technology quarterback Brandon Ziarno was arrested Friday on marijuana charges after a routine traffic stop yielded", "gen_tokens": [278, 20699, 310, 9881, 24261, 7088, 310, 1766, 26323, 1648, 29892, 22103, 18923, 10317, 805, 23195, 1171, 5953, 29889, 5677, 6764, 10920, 4083, 29889, 13, 29999, 4447, 1217, 29892, 29871, 29906, 29906, 29892, 310, 22103, 29892, 17240, 263, 937, 29899, 12163, 929, 1766, 26323, 1648, 17715, 8323, 322, 263, 8323, 310, 9241, 292, 385, 12139, 29892, 322, 338, 1641, 4934, 373, 395, 29896, 29945, 29892, 29900, 29900, 29900, 26130, 21224, 29889, 13, 29908, 29902, 29915, 29885, 1854, 1749, 937, 20136, 313, 275, 304, 29897, 1018, 304, 1284, 714, 565, 1749, 8368, 29899, 493, 2810, 338, 2869, 297, 7458, 470, 756, 2309, 3099, 2743, 1699, 306, 6040, 2343, 11182, 27665, 317, 546, 2003, 5429, 9736, 351, 3819, 29889, 510, 29889, 376, 4178, 278, 1095, 310, 278, 2462, 29892, 372, 29915, 29879, 1603, 701, 304, 278, 13813, 10317, 310, 7927, 1174, 1454, 13561, 322, 278, 4306, 6212, 25252, 29915, 29879, 11367, 304, 8161, 825, 29915, 29879, 1565, 322, 825, 11176, 2710, 515, 278, 22522, 1213, 13, 29999, 4447, 1217, 338, 263, 12616, 1627, 29914, 2696, 6270, 6276, 12398, 322, 5331, 278, 612, 4743, 5457, 1691, 304, 385, 29871, 29947, 29899, 29946, 12463, 2407, 445, 4259, 363, 385, 7992, 29903, 29899, 9536, 749, 2625, 29889, 23740, 4124, 535, 21614, 263, 9881, 29899, 3149, 22134, 1030, 5790, 1192, 278, 871, 563, 25790, 630, 5733, 3815, 9886, 297, 278, 29871, 29906, 29900, 29896, 29929, 4259, 29889, 13, 29908, 4806, 674, 9076, 2712, 1244, 472, 13813, 1920, 305, 408, 1532, 541, 472, 445, 931, 29892, 1749, 1667, 8569, 1492, 1286, 338, 373, 7863, 3271, 23511, 1699, 796, 4447, 1217, 5429, 383, 1806, 10130, 310, 385, 8859, 7159, 29909, 7353, 310, 534, 24551, 8024, 287, 2978, 670, 3271, 975, 278, 4723, 355, 29889, 13, 1576, 22564, 5304, 3721, 1023, 7378, 1156, 13813, 1920, 305, 29915, 29879, 1283, 29899, 24821, 375, 22420, 749, 19405, 6664, 10610, 393, 1754, 306, 6040, 278, 4654, 7992, 29903, 3815, 313, 271, 931, 310, 6664, 10610, 29892, 393, 5134, 13766, 29965, 322, 10815, 26286, 7367, 310, 278, 3014, 310, 20029, 29897, 304, 505, 967, 6931, 29185, 408, 263, 1121, 310, 7572, 508, 7183, 275, 1560, 17223, 5537, 800, 29889, 13, 29943, 1806, 756, 7436, 363, 337, 3200, 1241, 362, 310, 278, 9892, 29889, 13, 8050, 3118, 26428, 482, 310, 21755, 11345, 306, 9472, 27207, 10907, 28738, 414, 1757, 29915, 29879, 20305, 29892, 5866, 29915, 29879, 269, 11953, 29892, 22556, 3815, 3700, 1283, 15243, 523, 411, 1993, 21467, 363, 29871, 29953, 282, 29889, 29885, 29889, 26637, 3748, 931, 29889, 2, 1, 624, 1657, 297, 8090, 13661, 304, 5146, 363, 3133, 362, 1577, 13, 2744, 3148, 23236, 12590, 1852, 1041, 393, 13524, 8090, 526, 1407, 18215, 322, 10225, 310, 5684, 6993, 2113, 29915, 29873, 270, 1308, 2217, 413, 4841, 29889, 13, 4013, 5304, 408, 626, 4746, 2933, 304, 278, 4813, 264, 3748, 2805, 263, 1880, 770, 2164, 21700, 515, 278, 315, 4375, 29956, 29889, 13, 29965, 29890, 10718, 615, 769, 10049, 287, 304, 278, 12590, 322, 28705, 393, 896, 723, 5146, 9805, 414, 322, 18777], "output": "<s> Florida Institute of Technology quarterback Brandon Ziarno.\nMELBOURNE, Fla. - Florida Institute of Technology quarterback Brandon Ziarno was arrested Friday on marijuana charges after a routine traffic stop yielded the discovery of seven pounds worth of marijuana, Melbourne Police Department spokesman Det.

JOHNS COUNTY, Fla. - Commissioners in St. Johns County voted unanimously to postpone any legislative action against a localized ban of a substance that the DEA has classified as a Schedule 1 substance, including illicit trafficking and use of the drug for ultimate aggravation, according to a story by WFTX16 News in Jacksonville.\nSt. Johns County is one of 18 counties in Florida that is part of the Save Our State Act, which was designed to help educate voters about how money from marijuana sales could be used for bond construction. At issue in this debate is a state commission that is considering a localized ban of marijuana use.\nAs previously reported by the Miami Herald, the St. Johns County Commission is considering an amendment to the current zoning ordinance surrounding marijuana in the county, something that was emerging from conversations in the commission chambers on Monday in response to the state\u2019s legislative action on Sunday.\nSenate Bill 865 is also an amendment to the state\u2019s Controlled Substances Act that is designed to help the state more strictly control drug growth and potency. The bill, which passed with strong bipartisan support, includes essentially all of the language that is currently in the state\u2019s law that is known as past law cannabis.\nThat law does not include an explicit prohibition against marijuana planting or grows, but rather that it is specifically prohibited from being cultivated in or within 30 feet of any facility ordinarily leased for that use.\nUnder the terms of the law, it is now illegal for any private individual \u2013 including landowners and operators \u2013 to actually own or have control of marijuana farms, cannabis plants, or weed fields. Another change is legalizing all employers to now be able to hold people over 21 accountable for approving the hiring of convicted users of marijuana, as opposed to only those who have been convicted. Most employers previously could only hold people over 21 accountable in these cases, but not continuously.\nAn organization called Raise the Pen said in its press release that while that additional legal protection through the CSA law is certainly positive for the industry, amending the Controlled Substances Act may be a better approach. Knowing that it would be a completely different piece of legislation to travel to, then.\nNicole Dolan was arrested"}, {"prompt": "<s> APATZINGAN, Mexico \u2014 Federal forces struggled to bring order to western Mexico Wednesday as vigilantes battled a vicious drug cartel that apparently tried to reassert its authority by burning a downtown pharm", "gen_tokens": [4135, 304, 278, 5962, 29892, 3646, 292, 17162, 322, 5622, 4344, 29889, 13, 1349, 852, 13900, 892, 1701, 2356, 746, 278, 29871, 29953, 29900, 29900, 5144, 310, 263, 14877, 309, 1647, 2318, 15241, 385, 5337, 373, 528, 261, 2593, 30010, 29879, 20723, 583, 30010, 2594, 336, 4684, 472, 27470, 29892, 21142, 1497, 29889, 1383, 3554, 29892, 17774, 322, 16375, 21561, 892, 731, 373, 3974, 322, 2211, 4344, 892, 633, 2199, 287, 29889, 13, 1576, 4029, 29878, 928, 15134, 2996, 408, 17097, 8249, 731, 701, 1880, 29899, 11345, 26946, 453, 749, 304, 1284, 16676, 278, 6981, 333, 607, 5331, 304, 278, 1850, 287, 776, 310, 360, 11124, 6989, 12687, 3650, 18463, 262, 1346, 6489, 13741, 29877, 30024, 2088, 29920, 1171, 29892, 18451, 278, 10150, 12088, 5858, 297, 12568, 30010, 29879, 4955, 1919, 607, 1556, 13112, 723, 1833, 2440, 29889, 13, 8897, 306, 7120, 29892, 540, 338, 9963, 1048, 25757, 5342, 598, 29920, 29889, 13, 3112, 1838, 30010, 29873, 11176, 479, 1568, 515, 2400, 297, 2383, 29871, 29955, 29945, 472, 278, 9281, 297, 6225, 4101, 292, 273, 29889, 13, 12521, 276, 1953, 448, 313, 17491, 4272, 2400, 29897, 338, 4943, 409, 481, 441, 448, 338, 363, 385, 443, 262, 2616, 1971, 630, 4272, 411, 263, 8967, 4665, 2820, 29871, 29896, 29945, 29900, 29900, 2305, 322, 263, 5139, 4726, 432, 651, 411, 263, 5139, 19174, 310, 4359, 29871, 29945, 29900, 29892, 29900, 29900, 29900, 29889, 13, 18529, 11263, 860, 845, 804, 1033, 367, 10771, 297, 263, 5342, 598, 29920, 23927, 29716, 6446, 443, 12276, 287, 491, 1667, 5461, 3965, 29889, 13, 2499, 3592, 366, 750, 1023, 14368, 29892, 366, 881, 1925, 297, 278, 409, 481, 441, 310, 6225, 4101, 292, 1715, 937, 304, 2867, 445, 2246, 936, 7945, 310, 2714, 310, 372, 1641, 5342, 598, 29920, 9051, 470, 3386, 3598, 1811, 304, 2867, 372, 577, 591, 2113, 30010, 29873, 367, 2221, 304, 1303, 445, 274, 22875, 310, 263, 5828, 297, 278, 2446, 6507, 310, 278, 3965, 29889, 13, 29882, 25613, 785, 445, 10815, 3760, 457, 29920, 338, 2805, 502, 24173, 1244, 869, 869, 869, 13, 22110, 29874, 29892, 825, 526, 1906, 508, 3163, 2748, 1449, 5934, 1048, 591, 20830, 4121, 1467, 4059, 1237, 29973, 306, 2099, 306, 1854, 3282, 30010, 29873, 8293, 1048, 445, 1434, 541, 2041, 373, 372, 30010, 29879, 306, 2242, 392, 30010, 29879, 269, 11953, 1788, 29889, 13, 4591, 988, 723, 505, 1063, 1432, 7088, 263, 10322, 3700, 310, 278, 443, 29899, 4563, 272, 1133, 322, 274, 1049, 342, 457, 14576, 322, 7875, 322, 1722, 368, 6924, 11825, 310, 297, 14068, 289, 990, 6544, 4979, 3133, 5794, 8459, 304, 394, 819, 403, 1009, 3942, 5144, 29973, 13811, 1460, 3307, 540, 471, 451, 13229, 393, 12355, 267, 670, 1549, 12042, 6020, 1550, 2217, 29363, 746, 599, 491, 3654, 263, 11619, 29889, 13, 26772, 17924, 15366, 304, 8589, 4340, 2805, 8177, 310, 445, 17319, 8333, 885, 473, 479, 515, 1749, 13822, 2787, 502, 29889, 13, 3112, 769, 3512, 1346, 433, 274, 6637, 9541, 1764, 29889, 13, 29940, 2300, 1033, 451, 6219, 963], "output": "<s> APATZINGAN, Mexico \u2014 Federal forces struggled to bring order to western Mexico Wednesday as vigilantes battled a vicious drug cartel that apparently tried to reassert its authority by burning a downtown pharmacy to the ground, targeting workers and taking children.\nThose plans were foiled when the 600 members of a vigilante group launched an attack on sheriff\u2019s deputies\u2019 barracks at dawn, authorities said.

Sickinger had a strap he planned to use to bridle the horse later, but horses had never been amenable to strap punishment.\nA Columbia County record shows John Davi found his first registered horse. The paper, which was first published in 1905 and run for many years in the Shullsburg Greene County (now Oconto) Wisconsin State Journal newspaper, was self-published by Davi. (Citing an undated newspaper still in existence, I found the ownership of the copyright.) One of the first names appeared in the following 196 hemorrhages and plains people\u2019s list below the cover of the spacious front page: somewhere in there I listed the names of all who were claimed in the hemorrhages and plains list emergency and I came in around 75 at that time in this blood storm, but have not counted later defections. Davi\u2019s horse was purchased from a Long Branch farmer, and though when Davi purchased the colt he \u201cpaid $25 for the learned horse (but) he claimed $125 for it. In the background when Davi discussed things with Lewis\u201d is shown a Long Branch pictorial, in outline shape the Red River Valley past in canvass. Includes town of Greenwood in the frame. It is now part of the Oconto Falls, Wisconsin St. Paul Daily Tribune newspaper, showing two towns of the plains. The picture doesn\u2019t have the horses names, but the writing says simply, Long Branch. Davi died in 1919, at the age of 65. Lewis Davis received a copy of the newspaper as a prize for explaining how Davi had escaped his attack. Davi and Lewis were neighbors.\nIf I find the people in the photo, I will check out the obituaries. If I find more, I will add the names. Hemorrhages are very big. Most of them were nights and drills. At the St. Paul games (1908) decided the final, as we went through over two weeks of very bad punishment that nobody knows about through many wet nights. Lew Ellen\u2019s Covid amputation was uncommon, and his getting out when he did, thousands ahead of the time, was a rarity then. Drill traveling is very early on, in the game.

For our fellow victim hemorrhaging minds out there may I suggest a psychological principle \u2013 men spouting apologies are somewhere between churlish and cathartic.\nOn Thursday night Shull appeared on Inside Edition talking about the Virginia Tech shooting, including at length his inability to go easy on his ex-girlfriend.

As I watched his interview \u2013 and his interview is a difficult one to watch for us all \u2013 that very moment when the world says we matter is the time we have all been waiting for when sex and sexuality matter. We have long suffered here because even if you have good intentions sexual synergy is still interpreted as we\u2019re diminished. Here I had all that resting nervousness. Keep in mind when it came out I had been inspired enough about men in attendance with so-called good intentions \u2013 sportscasters, one DJ had sexually harassed my wife and I and when he heard we were in attendance to this account continuously decided the girlfriend as much as he has said this is very positive thing that can bring \u2013 brought through him to our daughter.\nWhether the kid is amused or unsettled by his father standing over her womanhood screaming \u201cWow, your pussy works.\u201d \u201cJust thankful she is safe.\u201d Only in America.

But they had no answer for Brandon Shull, who hit sixth consecutive home runs in his return from the disabled list.\nThe Diamondbacks (92-76) are 9-8 in their past 15 games and 24-5 in their last 30 Sunday. The Nationals (71-78) moved their season average of home runs per game from 4.73 to somewhere in the 4.40-to-4.30 region.\nIt appeared Shull emerged from the season\u2019s worst slump at exactly the right time.\nA day after allowing five home runs (including two fourth-inning bombs from Shultz), Shull came in when it mattered most and gave up just three hits and a walk -- the only hard contact he allowed -- in a scoreless inning. In his past 24 big-league appearances, Shull is 0-4 with a 23.26 ERA in 32 innings, a career-low for a Rockies' reliever.\nThe breakout was that much needed.\n\u201cAll that time off was just constructive for him,\u201d said Arizona manager Chip Hale, who made seven changes to the lineup in place of players who landed on the disabled list \u2013 including Carlos Martinez, who went 0-1 with a 6.12 ERA in four games since returning from Tommy John surgery. Mark Trumbo went 0-4.\nShull\u2019s three-run home run off Jerry Sullivan in the sixth knocked him out of the game and sent the Nationals across the Mile.

The overall sales volume for the month will make 2011 the 11th highest on record (year-to-date). Prior to February, March 2010 was the sixth highest ever for sales activity in the city.\nThe monthly average sale price in February was $210,933 for the 506 hemisphere homeswept by the MLS system; up .9 percent from January. In downtown Las Vegas, the average price was just $233,798, down slightly from January. East of the Strip, the average price was Up in February ($210,933) compared to $202,788 a month earlier. In West Henderson, the average price was $226,107 in February, up more than 9 percent from $195,994 a month earlier. The average price in South Las Vegas was unchanged at $246,236 in February.\nAlthough 2011 paid the dividend for sales volume, as those figures were positive from January to February, that was not the case for the market as a whole or compared with the average sales price for the overall metropolitan area for that time period.

The small firm used to develop and sell BASIC interpreters. Little did they know that in the next 40 years, their company will outgrow Microsoft software products, including BASIC. While millions of children grew up using the BASIC interpreter now that BASIC is no more, we here at VisualBasic.net feel a bit unsettled. Come to think about it, we cannot recall the last time that old people used BASIC.\nHere is a post, there was a post, and there were some posts before that. Now that everyone remembersSyntax Highlighter, it appears that we are forgetful. At our blog, we learn better by hemming and haweingos namely Syntax Highlighter. You see, all words can be viewed in an easy-to-remember structure. Tip: We always try to teach syntax via something easy to emerge and things more important. Syntax Highlighter is easy in this case. Not that you can't get right lectures about something else. It can be a Long Branching Path, Red Herring or Not Not Not which you may wish to learn. There are lots of learned jargons soaring high in heaven. You may want to take a post when you will learn things that could be of Earth-shattering significance. Recently, somebody asked me how I could recognize canaries. A gold whistle always belongs in the dustbin. So now we thought that the time has come to teach about Hoists of Errors. There are jokes and stripes on a hoist. The first type of hoists are placed when the world is shifting into the time of the bugs. Needless to say, Carlos Acuna is the one to do it because his Next Up has many hoists of synonyms explaining how often we we will mistype instead of writing each of our gorillas with precision. But hoist Syntax Highlighter can also reach you with some sour experiences. Holt's Hoist, worth a shot, puts five or one hoists. Most novices accomplish five but they drill down through the entries of innumerable bikes because they continuously put the red highlight as we cannot think what we can say.

The small firm used to develop and sell BASIC interpreters. Little did they know that in the next 40 years, their company will outgrow Microsoft software products, including BASIC. While millions of children grew up using the BASIC interpreter now that BASIC is no more, we here at VisualBasic.net feel a bit unsettled. Come to think about it, we cannot recall the last time that old people used BASIC.\nHere is a post, there was a post, and there were some posts before that. Now that everyone remembersSyntax Highlighter, it appears that we are forgetful. At our blog, we learn better by hemming and haweingos namely Syntax Highlighter. You see, all words can be viewed in an easy-to-remember structure. Tip: We always try to teach syntax via something easy to emerge and things more important. Syntax Highlighter is easy in this case. Not that you can't get right lectures about something else. It can be a Long Branching Path, Red Herring or Not Not Not which you may wish to learn. There are lots of learned jargons soaring high in heaven. You may want to take a post when you will learn things that could be of Earth-shattering significance. Recently, somebody asked me how I could recognize canaries. A gold whistle always belongs in the dustbin. So now we thought that the time has come to teach about Hoists of Errors. There are jokes and stripes on a hoist. The first type of hoists are placed when the world is shifting into the time of the bugs. Needless to say, Carlos Acuna is the one to do it because his Next Up has many hoists of synonyms explaining how often we we will mistype instead of writing each of our gorillas with precision. But hoist Syntax Highlighter can also reach you with some sour experiences. Holt's Hoist, worth a shot, puts five or one hoists. Most novices accomplish five but they drill down through the entries of innumerable bikes because they continuously put the red highlight as we cannot think what we can say.

But despite going through with the shambolic first encounter, it has now emerged they didn\u2019t really meet. Staveley was supposed to stay at Ashley\u2019s Bentall Park office farmhouse, there was supposed to be a chauffeur, there was supposed to be a manager, and the meeting was supposed to take place at 1pm. Instead, eight people ended up at Bentall Park yesterday, and Mr Ashley\u2019s girlfriend Amanda Staveley was not among them. The business chieftain and several of his top managers were their in attendance but no one was emerging from the premises. \u201cThere has been a complete inability to carry out those first few pieces of business together,\u201d an independent source told MailOnline. \u201cAmanda never held a meeting in our brasserie before we decided to go straight to Bentall Park -- the only reason I can ever think of was due to the fact Mr Ashley may well have had some big things up his sleeve.\u201d Shortly before 4pm, a family staying at Bentall Park canvassed the air to see if the house was empty. It wasn\u2019t. The source speculated this was down to Staveley making excuses about her jollies with her sister and a friend. The maid later confirmed that a group of guests came through the front door of Bentall Park and then went back outwards.\u201dI can confirm that while we were holding a meeting at Bentall, many of the media continued to arrive once the meeting finished.\u201d Added Groundhog Marketing chief Jim Adams: \u201cWhen Mike Ashley walked out of Bentall after having Iceland\u2019s sour pops or the so-called \u2018beef sandwiches\u2019 hit the fan, had he known what was to follow? Mike Ashley is just as smart as innumerable boring football managers. In the business hotel as we went through the fanfare of the first Andrew Craig match-night meeting through to the film and subsequent dinner at a pub a couple of blocks away, we each took a seat at our respective table.

At a time Democrats were rioting and Republicans were rallying then, the mood swung in favor of a former publisher and som"}, {"prompt": "</s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s>", "gen_tokens": [1, 28420, 3675, 1, 31983, 1662, 1485, 2267, 30010, 29892, 626, 29889, 937, 373, 2675, 29889, 706, 29874, 297, 5925, 15411, 29871, 2407, 411, 1642, 1286, 373, 29901, 373, 7751, 3086, 29901, 29889, 3896, 411, 4004, 10932, 29896, 937, 18165, 29892, 1529, 29889, 3624, 29889, 674, 29991, 1065, 29900, 29285, 29889, 3025, 29329, 1383, 913, 9937, 322, 297, 5275, 29889, 455, 2030, 22717, 30191, 261, 392, 29899, 310, 2972, 3926, 20473, 17888, 29908, 29892, 265, 29889, 288, 29889, 29875, 681, 313, 29907, 13, 334, 13055, 474, 8766, 746, 2817, 414, 29892, 784, 16676, 15205, 2646, 292, 7303, 22275, 29946, 8469, 472, 297, 311, 29889, 306, 786, 1189, 9475, 29889, 29889, 292, 1051, 29953, 9736, 302, 26115, 6850, 705, 660, 359, 2305, 6948, 471, 11517, 25971, 856, 288, 432, 370, 805, 823, 8736, 1556, 16611, 13, 9051, 1400, 521, 15198, 6462, 315, 322, 24352, 29918, 323, 425, 18830, 275, 9982, 30163, 297, 4013, 298, 8518, 29914, 29892, 29955, 11176, 25927, 322, 8441, 2400, 3114, 2383, 29892, 29892, 29905, 472, 22883, 5020, 297, 6225, 352, 333, 3676, 29889, 937, 18948, 394, 29871, 448, 313, 2967, 29900, 29880, 29873, 29892, 4943, 409, 2541, 29889, 263, 338, 363, 29973, 4934, 839, 13, 6946, 746, 21617, 29873, 29892, 2941, 272, 30098, 13, 29889, 12907, 29877, 29918, 29892, 29899, 1192, 13, 10972, 432, 313, 8691, 24347, 4362, 19174, 2133, 17914, 29889, 1178, 10578, 29892, 29879, 29889, 2891, 29915, 1919, 22877, 11263, 23943, 12802, 6289, 1497, 29892, 3643, 11563, 29889, 13899, 14121, 6257, 515, 14198, 261, 13, 27406, 29889, 15497, 29889, 13, 29908, 30103, 29905, 508, 9589, 651, 3025, 7684, 322, 714, 13888, 4706, 310, 664, 17718, 322, 6548, 29889, 13, 29940, 1161, 29871, 29947, 29900, 1634, 10123, 975, 2246, 393, 5148, 763, 13, 13, 13, 11242, 13777, 2248, 416, 432, 834, 5267, 4776, 869, 13, 7514, 287, 17018, 280, 22856, 363, 278, 1833, 4832, 7378, 636, 306, 29915, 29885, 263, 2107, 982, 297, 278, 29871, 29896, 29929, 29955, 29953, 29900, 29879, 472, 746, 306, 937, 10972, 304, 22203, 29889, 13, 13, 2328, 1938, 14359, 29915, 29879, 8084, 5020, 8228, 304, 319, 6344, 6978, 6418, 29911, 2965, 5300, 450, 716, 390, 29990, 29925, 1632, 618, 28041, 3878, 29939, 29889, 13, 3727, 29891, 29871, 29941, 29900, 18322, 1525, 17298, 718, 29906, 29900, 718, 29945, 21107, 2965, 306, 2242, 392, 18322, 1525, 17298, 718, 29906, 29900, 718, 29945, 29871, 29896, 29941, 29900, 29892, 29871, 29896, 29900, 21696, 2596, 9859, 29901, 697, 23366, 29892, 2211, 360, 29943, 29879, 29889, 13, 13, 3596, 28648, 322, 11161, 310, 278, 624, 1657, 297, 29871, 29941, 29928, 478, 29947, 3133, 362, 376, 29882, 4821, 29908, 408, 639, 278, 341, 7230, 29940, 5106, 29889, 13, 4597, 1848, 25222, 393, 4021, 1598, 29901, 1549, 3544, 20330, 310, 11706, 675, 856, 13, 29925, 3757, 279, 433, 626, 495, 25413, 17924, 29892, 4813, 264, 29892, 2805, 964, 278, 3699, 29991, 13, 2855, 1156, 315, 3289, 29991, 13, 29931, 799, 29876, 278, 10791, 669, 1136, 310, 22471, 29979, 413, 307, 305, 29889, 13, 29940, 271, 29915, 29879, 6570, 29907], "output": "</s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s><s> pulling\u00fcck<s>\u026faneausret\u2019, am. first on going.orya in research Columbia  record with\". now on: on ship National:. enter with section glad1 first fonction,MA.Is. will! run0 servlet. via Stanis\u0142aw Shull Jon and inography.ci old SI\u00aderand- ofgroup ever Commun farm\",on. o.ious (C\n * separated iGC whenarmers, colSyntax owned graing couple redund4 proceed at inde.

Camping stores have started catering to the ultra-serious outdoor crowd by exclusively offering weed shirts, and decked-out decorations sporting cannabis pots have started popping up.\nWill people like fast-food restaurants more now than they did in the late 90s and early 2000s? Maybe. Can we judge which markets they\u2019re in from the national ad campaigns they come out with? Definitely. But I can\u2019t see a nationwide spike in spending on a fast-food chicken-caesar salad. Will we start seeing their meatier hunkers, more emergency-room- style meals, burrito supreme in this trend, or will it be 2 minutes of cannabis chicken?\nFor a while they were held back by the fact brands simply weren\u2019t \u201cgetting it\u201d: there weren\u2019t (and are still not) enough advertisements targeting stoners when pot shops also debuted, nor specific pot-centered pushes like when True North created their marijuana-filtered seltzer and sang \u201cmarijuana love\u201d at concerts.\nBut that\u2019s starting to change, especially with Target\u2019s recent marketing campaign that features constructively stoner-based movies, such as Trainwreck, directed by Paul Feig, which have somehow managed to work their way into pop culture and inspire the latest ad campaigns from various fast-food chains.\nThis synergy is coming from advertisers entering this market for the first time, gaining a foothold. Keep in mind when it comes to marketing, no market should be treated the same, so as long as every company sees the face of the opportunity with the big. Most corporations accomplish that by keeping an eye open for opportunities, in other words, not blinkin\u2019 em blind, as we saw with Marnie\u2019s Tonics.\nSome additional market research through Google trends and the Web shows a new awareness of fast-food outdoors, and a new propensity towards advertising.

Moreover, the opening of the new freeway will have an impact in cutting down congestion on local roads near McCarran International Airport, the southern stretch of I-580 and Highway 95 when exiting to the nearby parks and recreation areas.\nThe top priority is to build eight new traffic signal control islands hemmed in by the I-580 freeway, according to spokesman for IDOT Michael Wynne. Clean-up crews surrounding the work zone are taking steps to ensure that no emergency damage was done in the construction, including ensuring that in each work zone, two first-aid kits will provide emergency care to workers and passengers. Long enough to held temperature of critical when necessary, the kits contain enough first-aid devices and supplies that no casualties were verified on scene due to idiocy. In the background, buses and also trucks stuck in traffic jams will push their completely loaded, empty I-580 motorways to prevent any damage and to take the burden off IECA crews.\nLocal news sources speculate this I-580 extension would be the most expensive in US history when taking into consideration a build-out of the 3-thousand-foot work zone, cost overhaul of all security barriers when guarded, erosion control work, earth dredging and bulldozing projects involving wood and cement streets, heavy weigh stations, even a barrier wall all that will cost the state.

The first thing you need to ensure is your date of departure is in the January quarter of the year you are traveling \u2013 this will assist in getting the cheapest carrier for your flights from March. The month of January usually has the cheapest rates for flights even though it is usually the most expensive month of travel.\nOne way to save money is to select a month with a less expensive arrival date or time so as to save money on your return flights. Remember one way flights are return flights so you will only be paying money for the flights if you do not continu on to the European hotel as per the quoted itinerary.\nRegional carriers can also be really cheap for long haul flights.\nAs you amble around the European streets you will probably get that holly jolly feeling and not want to go back to the busy cacophony of life in Singapore.

Many of the customers they are targeting are chosing to use VMware vRealize Performance for helping them to better handle demand fluctuation in their software.\nWhat he means is our current automation solution is missing those Qos features that Cloud providers are offering \u2013 for instance, can\u2019t ping somewhere in Amsterdam using a Cisco APM compatible device, and their customers are noticing something similar. emergency?\nWell, we have recently launched at Smart in Apollon, which is a system that defeats threat from Internet Protocol Address Shorting attacks \u2013 is for an IDS to find when brute-force attack goes past its typical query rate, and when the system detects something unusual, sends a Generic DNAT. In that case when a customer makes an attempt at pinging specific location in Amsterdam, pushes completely unchanged, the system will start returning replies quickly but via an insecure proxy server. In the IEEE Journal of Emerging Technologies and Systems (2007) we present an attack that breaks out of domain and time resolution principles by exploiting Internet Protocol Address Shorting that a standard generic DNAT is making possible.\nChallenge of security that is when you need to secure the Internet while you\u2019re here because a Next Generation IPsec was what changed everything this year once Broadcomm announced we\u2019re working on an IPsec version 6.0 with improved resistance.

I love everything this morning once Kaylee came we talked for about a half hour and I got to tell her how much I love her but she\u2019s not letting I tell her I love her back. If I told her how much I love her she would face me and start crying but. Most of all I love watching Star Wars and Mario Brothers at the hospital in between bouts of bliss.

There is a growing sense that despite pushing talent to the school academies, the number who enter education is puny, when actually, the nation has 281,000 vacancies.\nState schools owe a lot to the 80,000 who train with them each year - who do not wish or plan to work in a difficult job.

Now that everyone remembersSyntax Highlighter, it appears that we are forgetful. At our blog, we learn better by hemming and haweingos namely Syntax Highlighter. You see, all words can be viewed in an easy-to-remember structure. Tip: We always try to teach syntax via something easy to emerge and things more important. Syntax Highlighter is easy in this case. Not that you can't get right lectures about something else. It can be a Long Branching Path, Red Herring or Not Not Not which you may wish to learn. There are lots of learned jargons soaring high in heaven. You may want to take a post when you will learn things that could be of Earth-shattering significance. Recently, somebody asked me how I could recognize canaries. A gold whistle always belongs in the dustbin. So now we thought that the time has come to teach about Hoists of Errors. There are jokes and stripes on a hoist. The first type of hoists are placed when the world is shifting into the time of the bugs. Needless to say, Carlos Acuna is the one to do it because his Next Up has many hoists of synonyms explaining how often we we will mistype instead of writing each of our gorillas with precision. But hoist Syntax Highlighter can also reach you with some sour experiences. Holt's Hoist, worth a shot, puts five or one hoists. Most novices accomplish five but they drill down through the entries of innumerable bikes because they continuously put the red highlight as we cannot think what we can say. One thing that can be learned from through hoists is that the older you get the more you amuse yourself by iteration. Yop! Hoists are not always incorrect and Cyrillic can be mistyped too.

As a Bengali with an MBBS degree, did you never feel the pressure to pursue a medical career?\nThere is always pressure on you while taking risks. Opposition from family and society will always stop you from taking risks. We, all first had to face this resistance and we all had to overcome it emotionally, mentally and socially with all our hearts. Writing, playing music and dealing with many roadblocks is not comfortable and we cannot move in the same space as people from all social strata. But we stayed true to our passions and did it anyway.\nWhat is the darkest moment you\u2019ve faced as a music director? What has helped you deal with it?\nMy first dark moment was in Bangalore during my placement at a music production company. I had paid all the clarifed amounts somewhere in chennai and asked the Tally man in Bangalore to put the salary in emergency account. He did not have the faintest idea in which form the money was saved. When later on I demanded the verification, he denied my request and said they never held money in the emergency account! Through which I got \u201cWHERE IS MY REMOVAL-VACCICLES FROM 2020-2021 MY PAYMENT INC.\u2019S\u201d from the managing director. All this completely broke my heart. Looking back I think I can safely say my first dark moment paid the dividends later on. It made me even more responsible than I could have been otherwise. Also, a very refreshing moment was singing and sharing the stage with a friend. The first show I ever sang in I did the world rights myself in Bangalore and the audience loved my voice when I lip synched the single while singing my own compositions. Next feeling from my profession which changed everything for me once and for all was my debut concert in 2012. I had nervously played my debut song in Haridwar and I had lost my heart that night. If I had not sung the song worth a moment face of the night with DJ Num. Baahubali nights and drunk open mic nights made innumerable good memories for continuously decided to be a music director.\nHow do you overcome the roadblocks that come in your way as music director?\nThe first step is a willingness to accept the roadblocks. It may be mental block, physical block or financial block. There are many sharing their experiences on the internet on this and many.

He was unaffected by fame. But now he is focused on reviving his film career for an actor who has the face of God, power and humility. So he is a very shrewd businessman. Athirapuyyum idhu, Manu mayanum thedi kein kuru vichirukkal,\" he said.\nSuriya, who is known to stun in his 20+ movies, said he has been playing a bad guy for 2 decades but is giving his best performance ever in the critically acclaimed Radha Madhava .\n\"Radha Madhav is not that bad guy character where you shout inappropriately and drive people crazy. Now he is playing a very complex character. He is here because his role is from the film which is synonymous with holiness and reflection as well. In the near future I plan to double my income to 60% but first part of this year I am shooting in Raigad. If I prepare so well in the new material, I will be hit by one DJ number. Most of my films are based on drought. I am now effective in these films as this theme continuously runs in my films as Raaga plays an important character in Radha Madhava,\" he announced through his Twitter handle.\nThe film's success is ample proof for Monga.

The Texas GOP also wants the fall elections moved up.\nThe runoff elections is not really partisan, and in Jerry Madaleno's last year as AG, two Democrats ran, one was primary victorious and one was set to lose the runoff.\nMadaleno did graciously step aside and hand the top spot over to Roland Gutierrez after he won the primary.\nwe did the same thing this year, but the jewish population kept most of the zio chitlins and zio TP was fairly easy.\nThis is the interesting thing though emerging from Governor Abbott. He wants the runoff elections in Fall, although he will have to get 51% of the votes to win the race.\nJim Henson, of the eccentric Fringe Festival and Bachelorette shows fame, and Marti no more (Bachelorette 12), did repeat comments from a couple years ago that he also favors a September run-off.\nBoth completely un-precedented in Texas past historically.\nIt is very likely that the AG will come up with a new substitute date for the first run-off election that is released well enough in advance that most political jockeys know which date it will be. Maybe it will not be a holiday date either, but that is the most likely possibility.\nThere is also a significant Carlos Acuna influence in that concept as well.\nHence, what Governor Abbott is asking for is something new.\nAlso unlike his first run-off elections, that was a sorry affair.\nTV people were part of it, I am told, though that is not necessarily verified.\nBGU, worth a shot, of course, but DJT.

When recording older material, particularly when it has been heavily processed, we have noticed that the amps that we use have an annoying hum caused by recordings aging on old surfaces like vinyl. When we cleaned up all the hum, our Amplify! 20 is recording with much more detail and in higher fidelity. The clarity of the original sound is preserved, however there is a lot more information (information that would usually be lost when recording multiple channels to tape) and the redundancy of channels in recording software is gone. You should save any recordings you might have taken with a harmonica or piano before you start using Amplify! 20. The dust chips off the surface of the TG20 and the keyboard unit is very easy to replace by unscrewing its plastic top, then taking off the front panel assembly. It will have to be replaced - no base can be used again. If you saved a recording for an event, you would want to permanently record that event.\nWHERE TO USE IT -- Using the sound processor with a quartet or a combi-system. In a background recording of a big band, or a stage band. Short music clips. Recording a family reunion with your past in can conjunction with an oral history archive of an old neighborhood. For instance -- we thought that the hum might come from that building with all of those records that used to jingle when the trolley went by. Maybe it was not that bad. If the world is shifting into the digital age, and if that building has been updated, you can get the same sound by creating an MP3 of each chipped-off synch of the records ... or we could clean it up for you.</s><s> I have been writing for about 10 years and started writing speculative fiction in 2014.

The ReadyNAS enjoyed a very busy first shipment and is expected to ship with a first-generation system.\nThe ReadyNAS is a zero-maintenance, low-cost, easily manageable server-like device that allows users to build a networked storage devices like a NAS and mirror or backup their contents to multiple ReadyNASes.\nThe ReadyNAS is driven by the fanless i.MX6 hemisphere A8 smart-enabled quad-core ARM processor, based on the 64-bit ARM Cortex A8 architecture. Together, these elements translate into high-performance, low-power consumption connected storage in a network device.\nFeatures in this form factor include NIC-based 1G base band Internet protocol connections to seamlessly integrate is to an existing home networking infrastructure.\nIn terms of performance, the ReadyNAS delivers the highest hard disk controllability available in a 5-in-1 storage device when coupled with an Intel 6 series P-state controller. All of the controller-related I/Os are accessible in driver-specific via an integrated Linux system support of an Intel i.MXNV 8010 Linux Wi-Fi wireless controller.\nThe ReadyNAS integrates with i.MX6 base-band mobile broadband that provides voice, data, video, streaming video over Wi-Fi and security to create a low-cost home based single networked storage solution. It provides Next Generation IP TV, which is synergistic once the new Genie multi-room DVR receiver is included.\nWith the addition of the Genie DVR, the ISPs\u2019 broadband personnel can attend to the customers as needed and everyday activities. An integral part of Next Generation IP is the 10X Netgear Voice Gateway.\nAs a hub to this hub continuity delivery, Netgear has built the netGEAR ReadyNAS with that additional enhancement through its customers, and the Voice Gateway completes the picture.

Needless to say this resulted in the design of an efficient furnace for a lime kiln. The top vent can be left open allowing air to be evacuated directly into each of the gases. Centralising the bottom vent would normally result in the need to provide a perforated tube system or chimney-like pipework to each stack face.

The study, released Monday, contends that factors not just age but also race and socioeconomic status are easily identified as markers of health.\nThe study, called Latino Attitudes Toward Health Behavior, looked at the beliefs of Hispanics in Raquette Lake, N.Y., and Virginia Beach, Va. The findings didn\u2019t bear out those beliefs: Latinosessed up less to the recommended preventive health care for smoking, cholesterol and blood pressure.\nBut David J. Kessler, the study\u2019s lead researcher, said the study \u201cchallenges the incontrovertible notion that it is age - or race or class - that is the main factor in ill health.\u201d What we need to do, he said, is to spend \u201ca good deal of attention on the issue of social factors so that we can focus more on identifying those factors than on pushing people to act on the theory\u201d that specific conditions like cardiovascular disease are related to age or race.\nAlthough 21 percent of Latinos said in the survey they would \u201cNever thought about\u201d getting health screenings, Dr. Rogelio Fernandez, of Temple University\u2019s School of Medicine and Reporting for America participants for that study, found that the belief is widely held.\nChanging attitudes on social factors \u2013 and Carlos Martinez, an 82-year-old from Boston, has changed from this attitude once before \u2013 may be the key to addressing serious diseases like heart disease.\nIf Americans habituated to partying and socializing in high numbers could change their attitudes about the issue, in the decades ahead there may be hope for one of the highest rates of death from heart disease and cancer in developed nations.\nIn Taormina, a Sicilian coastal town in Italy, Raquel Mastroianni is very positive about health.\nShe won through dental school and worked as a dentist for a year before going to art school.

That is a hemorrhoidsweileros namely a few kill-joy jews words clarifed however somewhere in there I could convince myself he is talking about how Black guys in Black hoodies will beat emergency decisions more in America than Jews do at any time in Jewish history. Not that Jerry believes this - he makes several verbal errors on the show.\nJerry held a Red Robin when brunette powerlifted his hemorrhoidsweileros learned jewish actors sometimes look like guys. This movie showed exactly why. Jerry when jerry things up could be funnier. Short but punchy,\nPenguins is the same brain in canada but had two air out guys hoisted in the air. It's hard enough having to replicate an atmosphere that is not there without making excuses about it.\nBesides, a lot of what existed in the 80s would make the world a shitty place. The music, for instance. Nowadays, you can find yourself listening to old hip-hop that has changed since the early 90s. And even weirder, even though Mark and Simon were gorillas, even though their tricks were part of the formula I used in Jerry Fly about men, when I was 13, every once in a while, they will one-up.

Moreover, Florida defensive coordinator Ryan Kelly became the first known college coach with consecutive fumbles committed as he picked off Jeff Duvall with 34 seconds left to give Ohio State a 29-21 lead.\nNot one to rest on his predecessor\u2019s achievement, the eight-time Pro Bowl tackle crossed the line with QB C.J Spiller on the right side for a 73-yard fumble recovery on the Jaguars\u2019 next play, and a mere 17 seconds later, emerged triumphantly below the pylon for what would be in all likelihood the final first-half score.

In the post-Daniels era things really could get ugly when Dante Taylor is punting, because Daniels was absolutely the best returning kicker in the country two weeks ago (according to the AP), having made 97% of his kicks with Wilber Hoover a year ago. Which means that if Taylor is trying to break a rifle ordinance, the NCAA might actually do something about it when he practices (at quarterback, for crying out loud). But Carlos Martinez is going to do well because Daniels absolutely flunked out of synch on once-per-game zero-point instead of Mark Stoops\u2019 gimmick of keeping the ball out of the end zone. So I\u2019m just going to assume that next week the stage-filled stands are worth zero points to Billy Higgins, but I wouldn\u2019t mind seeing Higgins and Mario Testinette (a potential bust this year continuing decidedly uninspired chemistry) doing a lot of replay miles that week. As for Taylor, while this same scenario might happen with a perfectly ample kicker, Keenan Reynolds needs to know that thousands and thousands of feet aren\u2019t going to tell the truth.

Therefore, the 2007 paid mortgage balance is $400,780 plus breakage amounts that occurred on 6/1/07.\n\"At the time a paid balance Report existed, the loan was reported to be paid in full when we paid the 20 percent down payment on the property.

They lack due-diligence to confirm that the loan is current and a proper amortization presentation, and based on the facts that are available, they reject it.

Moreover, the opening scene of Gossip Girl will have Jon and Greer killing each other. The opening scenes are of such significant nature that I, for one, do not like to re-read them lest when I re-watch the episode, I feel redundantly terrorized. It seems I go through eight seasons of our shows in hemibk\u0119.\nLeos may have finally come to the end of another chapter of their most entangled feud. Finally. Let the healing begin.\nIt warms my heart that something awesome finally emerges from Pinterest.

The finale of each season was what it continued to be once the new season started\u2013summed up, at each stop, in a spectacular. But the finale is part of the series I am discussing here about the story.\nFrom the moment in the series premiere that subscribes five minutes with Nat had. Most of my accomplishments are gained through my understanding of money.\nAs a lawyer, this meant continuing to empathize as much as I could with people who were suffering under lack of means.

I can't believe I forgot to take the glove off and [feel] it.\"\nAfter reporters asked about his stolen base against the Cardinals, Adam replied with a staggered \"Oh, sure.\"\n\"It went up, I bet Paul did,\" Hairston said. \"I think that was when he put Carlos Martinez in there to do his thing.

The colonnaded quays which stretch from the Seine in the west, to the famous Montmartre area in the northeast, and from the riverside Arc de Triomphe jewel box at the downtown border with \u00cele de la Cit\u00e9, were blanketed by row upon row of wooden structures, emerging from the more northerly riverside at Gothic infection, often stretching out to another 2 minutes beyond them.

On land these were very much the learned casual landscape of libraries and potteries, boulangeries and museums, buskers and academics, cr\u00e8me-operated p\u00e2tisseries and taxi silhouettes, pastel canvases and gold and stone paid for of all things oysters and champagne. The first time you come to Paris by train or bus it\u2019s as if somewhere or other time in your brain a rifle has been fired and for that very moment all bets are off, and the time is now, for that very individuality and texture you know.\nIn the mid 19th century, as the Industrial Revolution transformed the once sparsely peopled country even farther south and east, that casual landscape was forever transformed. One glance at it tells you Iceland\u2019s souring economy or the so-called BRIC nations economies face steeper uncertainties. Most of these cities are already far drastically more money-rich in land (for most call continuously decided emigrates as much as their net contribution to the very roadway that that additional supply brought through).

Spoilers tease that everybody will see lots of juicy scenes revolving around the Lulu and Ryan storyline and the January 25 show will seemingly set the stage.\nTomorrow\u2019s episode promises am all new storyline. Take a look at the new details with us now.\nGeneral Hospital Spoilers Reportedly Address Lulu\u2019s Writing Depression.Is Lulu Composing a Screenplay?\nWhat will Santa Montefinascione (Tom Divani) write next? He seems to be self-exiled from time to time (Cameron Mathison is still too depressed to write the same story). But what Lulu Montefinascione is about to do is not totally in contrast to her run-of-the-mill girl-on-the-rise experience.\nOf course, there will be the moment when he is deeply depressed and a comic relief comes along to give emergency help. One year ago, Lulu went through this in an episode of General Hospital and it actually was hilarious. In this scene, we saw a woman who never held herself together in any scene, even before her health situation.\nThe woman, Lulu needs to be (Bridgette Wilson) to flare up. In the background when she thinks kein things are happening, we see Lulu stating to herself that she needs a family stay-at-home job in order to see her husband, paid for of course. This kind of writing skills goes deeper than the life breakdown she is experiencing.\nWhat\u2019s more, this idea of writing a screenplay might just be the first step towards pursuing a career as a screenwriter. Let\u2019s see if Lula will actually do such a thing. Will she? We\u2019ll just have to worry.\nWho will be the person in this storyline coming up? Who will be this holiday party character? Who will be the persons that will find the people in the house after? I am quite curious about that. There will be the name-dropping every once in a while of the writers of Days of Our Lives.

Tretter, bishop of Passau (763) converted to the Christian faith, now that he had witnessed to the power of the glad tidings of the Savior\u2019s resurrection. But Vergilius died at Monte San Pietro, Novo (Paris), near Verona, on March 30, 789 (Cf. \u00a7\u00a7 85, 86). At the demand of the emperor in Rome he had gone to take the Apostolic sees hemmed in by those of the people\u2019s killers. He wished to spaciously plant his Church in Rome, so the bishop asked the Tyrant Pepo, son of the emperor, by way of Pepo\u2019s relations, at Gothen in Apulia, to have faith in his defection. The emperor spoke to the pope a word to remember, \u201cthat though when bringer of power he wins souls to his own, and when the learned ruler of Athens he lowers to idolatry, may well when his power is gone envy\u201d (Comment. cons. p. 468, ad MV pp. 1232-1233 of Tacitus, \u201cNatvs \u201d, 12, 25). The emperor then asked his associates and his kin to reprimand Vergilius for not making a better show of love for him in his dealings with the pope.

A mob reportedly beat up a local environmentalist who called for government officials to swim in a heavily polluted river in China.\nYet, we have never let China, all that is going wrong on the earth, nor the record with agencies that could do so much to save the planet, shrug off the efforts of a group of individuals who run cross country.\nAfter Shishim and Greer assisted the people of Lake Chad of Nigeria in their struggle against pollution that is destroying their future and livelihood, the response of our beloved Chinese government is to demand that the proceeds of the effort go to the eight people convicted for organizing the joint venture.\nAt the end of the day, it is all words. In some cases somewhere in china government has some money. Tens of billions a year.\nIt is easy for emerging and connected leaders in America, or Europe, to provide incentives, rewards and lessons learned - right? Because the stakes are so high.\nTheir resources are so large.\nBut China, an emerging republic of 1.3 billion people needs learned lessons. Very badly. Very badly.\nNext, China needs leaders, champions of sustainable development who embody Earth-smart and push their country in that direction.</s><s> Mechanical engineers are instrumental in generating efficient ways of moving an object from one place to another. Mechanical engineers break this task down by creating innovative ways on how to move an object without using power whereas a power engineer would ordinarily design the process that actually makes any movement possible. Essentially, the role of engineers is to create functioning and efficient solutions in design while power engineers usually focus on how to generate electrical energy.\nAn extensive career in engineering is as much of an education as one can obtain and gain sufficient knowledge of. This means that people in the field of engineering need to have a broad education in order to gain the necessary skills in the everyday processes that face engineers. This could involve taking a few classes in an engineering level, and then going into the field in order to become a professional continuously gaining vital experience as time progresses.\nThe degree of education that meets that qualification is based on the demands of the field. There are a lot of industries that require specialised training, and this is another aspect that engineers should have in order to get started. Industries like the automobile producing industry advise engineers to get degrees in"}, {"prompt": "</s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s>", "gen_tokens": [1, 28420, 3675, 1, 31983, 1662, 1485, 2267, 30010, 29892, 626, 29889, 937, 373, 2675, 29889, 706, 29874, 297, 5925, 15411, 29871, 2407, 411, 1642, 1286, 373, 29901, 373, 7751, 3086, 29901, 29889, 3896, 411, 4004, 10932, 29896, 937, 18165, 29892, 1529, 29889, 3624, 29889, 674, 29991, 1065, 29900, 29285, 29889, 3025, 29329, 1383, 913, 9937, 322, 297, 5275, 29889, 455, 2030, 22717, 30191, 261, 392, 29899, 310, 2972, 3926, 20473, 17888, 29908, 29892, 265, 29889, 288, 29889, 29875, 681, 313, 29907, 13, 334, 13055, 474, 8766, 746, 2817, 414, 29892, 784, 16676, 15205, 2646, 292, 7303, 22275, 29946, 8469, 472, 297, 311, 29889, 306, 786, 1189, 9475, 29889, 29889, 292, 1051, 29953, 9736, 302, 26115, 6850, 705, 660, 359, 2305, 6948, 471, 11517, 25971, 856, 288, 432, 370, 805, 823, 8736, 1556, 16611, 13, 9051, 1400, 521, 15198, 6462, 315, 322, 24352, 29918, 323, 425, 18830, 275, 9982, 30163, 297, 4013, 298, 8518, 29914, 29892, 29955, 11176, 25927, 322, 8441, 2400, 3114, 2383, 29892, 29892, 29905, 472, 22883, 5020, 297, 6225, 352, 333, 3676, 29889, 937, 18948, 394, 29871, 448, 313, 2967, 29900, 29880, 29873, 29892, 4943, 409, 2541, 29889, 263, 338, 363, 29973, 4934, 839, 13, 6946, 746, 21617, 29873, 29892, 2941, 272, 30098, 13, 29889, 12907, 29877, 29918, 29892, 29899, 1192, 13, 10972, 432, 313, 8691, 24347, 4362, 19174, 2133, 17914, 29889, 1178, 10578, 29892, 29879, 29889, 2891, 29915, 1919, 22877, 11263, 23943, 12802, 6289, 1497, 29892, 3643, 11563, 29889, 13899, 14121, 6257, 515, 14198, 261, 13, 27406, 29889, 15497, 29889, 13, 29908, 30103, 29905, 508, 9589, 651, 3025, 7684, 322, 714, 13888, 4706, 310, 664, 17718, 322, 6548, 29889, 13, 29940, 1161, 29871, 29947, 29900, 1634, 10123, 975, 2246, 393, 5148, 763, 13, 13, 13, 11242, 13777, 2248, 416, 432, 834, 5267, 4776, 869, 13, 7514, 287, 17018, 280, 22856, 363, 278, 1833, 4832, 7378, 636, 306, 29915, 29885, 263, 2107, 982, 297, 278, 29871, 29896, 29929, 29955, 29953, 29900, 29879, 472, 746, 306, 937, 10972, 304, 22203, 29889, 13, 13, 2328, 1938, 14359, 29915, 29879, 8084, 5020, 8228, 304, 319, 6344, 6978, 6418, 29911, 2965, 5300, 450, 716, 390, 29990, 29925, 1632, 618, 28041, 3878, 29939, 29889, 13, 3727, 29891, 29871, 29941, 29900, 18322, 1525, 17298, 718, 29906, 29900, 718, 29945, 21107, 2965, 306, 2242, 392, 18322, 1525, 17298, 718, 29906, 29900, 718, 29945, 29871, 29896, 29941, 29900, 29892, 29871, 29896, 29900, 21696, 2596, 9859, 29901, 697, 23366, 29892, 2211, 360, 29943, 29879, 29889, 13, 13, 3596, 28648, 322, 11161, 310, 278, 624, 1657, 297, 29871, 29941, 29928, 478, 29947, 3133, 362, 376, 29882, 4821, 29908, 408, 639, 278, 341, 7230, 29940, 5106, 29889, 13, 4597, 1848, 25222, 393, 4021, 1598, 29901, 1549, 3544, 20330, 310, 11706, 675, 856, 13, 29925, 3757, 279, 433, 626, 495, 25413, 17924, 29892, 4813, 264, 29892, 2805, 964, 278, 3699, 29991, 13, 2855, 1156, 315, 3289, 29991, 13, 29931, 799, 29876, 278, 10791, 669, 1136, 310, 22471, 29979, 413, 307, 305, 29889, 13, 29940, 271, 29915, 29879, 6570, 29907], "output": "</s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s></s><s> pulling\u00fcck<s>\u026faneausret\u2019, am. first on going.orya in research Columbia  record with\". now on: on ship National:. enter with section glad1 first fonction,MA.Is. will! run0 servlet. via Stanis\u0142aw Shull Jon and inography.ci old SI\u00aderand- ofgroup ever Commun farm\",on. o.ious (C\n * separated iGC whenarmers, colSyntax owned graing couple redund4 proceed at inde.

It has not had a sufficient spur to reform, despite the platitudes by both Sarkozy and Hollande. The fall of the Berlin Wall was a great spur to Germany, though it may not have had a corresponding effect on France. At all events, the German model worked in the short-term with aggressive indiscriminate bombing by the Allies. The French, who received some bombing from the Allied forces via the UK, cannot recall the cultural impact of the War or the subsequent reconstruction. They are now self-righteous moralists (Campbell is right on when suggesting that this colt is grazing in redundancy). One in every four French nationals thinks Europe is not better off hemmed in by those whom they may have supported kill-or-be-kill; however most of the skeptics are so lacking in enthusiasm for Europe that their inadequacy has been more emergent than connected to the particular travails of Europe itself.\nThis is often explained as the impression abroad that defeats in France will determine the outcome of the Eurocrisis. But we should be aware of the opposite view which goes like \u201cBerlin is a very special case because we (the UK) are in a similar position to repeat the exact situation post-WW2 also here in France.\u201d\nA Short Space to Cover a Recent Crisis\nSince the start of 15 February, two airline disasters in the IEA have made front page headlines. On 2 February, France Inter published a substantial refutation of one or more of the preliminary reports. The first involved the demise of Iberia\u2019s London Heathrow Airline (Iberia Flight 9285) while overflying London on a lath from Madrid. The second involved the demise of Alitalia Flight 1963 off the coast of southern France. This was the first instance when visible fuel tanks were lost in the crash.

It determines whether your bank will lend you money to buy a house or car; whether your landlord will accept you as a tenant; which employers will hire you or even whether your family will let you into their house.\nHi, this is Ryan Hughes, now that we got that out of the way we\u2019re gonna discuss about how a positive reputation will make a difference to your company, career and life and in doing that we\u2019ll discuss how reputation strategy of a company is critical to surviving in this time of recession and uncertainty.\nThe strategy of positive online reputation starts the same as the lack of it ended in the first place. Before looking at online reputation it is important for you to understand the difference between good and bad reputation. You see, all words can be negative or positive but there are three items that determine the health of our reputation: their technicality, the quality of the emerging and the usefulness. Let\u2019s look at these in turn.\nA good first impression is gained when we base our verdict on regular use of words such is for an event, colour of our brush, quantity or type of wine we\u2019ve drunk that day or the name of a company we patronise. This is normal. In the modern world every word makes an impression. It is when a person becomes more punctual in his speech that you determine how reliable they can be. A gold star to a star of an Olympic champion. It is now time for positive reputation to break this pattern that is needed to a substantial degree.\nSo, now constructively trying to break this cycle what makes your verdict for that particular word. Let us look at the words the most influential and will determine the function of an organisation.\nThese words should always be accurate. Next, each corporate has their own opinions of them. With such we will be able to create a \u2018spin\u2019 on these words that facilitate our mission statement and visible brand. I am now inspired enough about the keywords.\nFrom the website in the everyday reality there are simple five goals one could achieve. Most corporates accomplish these easily and drastically. In fact, in most industry sectors within continuously decided the business goal as per the pattern of doing business.

it condemns them to pay high broadband prices.\nThe Nationals believe that NBN should have been allotted to the private sector as it was the cheapest route, now that Telstra owns the infrastructure with no subsequent cost.\n\"They are paid twice the price for something that is not cheap and will not be in their interests anyway,\" Mr Turnbull said of NBN Co's $45 billion product.\nCiting an ACCC report suggesting that online content providers would pay up to $8500 per premises for NBN Co's hemibreached product, Mr Turnbull condemned the NBN spokesman for being misleading.\n\"We think $45 billion is a fairly expensive product in itself but they are paying emergency rates connected to Telstra, Telstra at huge rates in this case, then NBN at emergency rates which is not even connected to Telstra.\"\nMr Turnbull highlighted the fact that NBN Co's rural hemibreached service -- which only directly connects to Telstra's national NBN ring -- may well be paid by big Telco customers, such as Optus.\n\"If you are actually buying nationwide fibre in canny you see two choices, paid by Telstra or paid by someone else -- or maybe they are paying for NBN Co -- NBN Co could buy somewhere or construct somewhere in order to turn around and make pretty much the same that they would make if it was simply paid by the network!\" he said.\n\"So there is nothing to stop them doing that.\"\n\"[Turnbull has] been described as a canary in the coal mine as far as this broadband is concerned,\" NBN Co spokeswoman Karen Murphy said.\n\"Mr Turnbull should be treated with confidence,

How do you make sure you're implementing it?\n\"Every six weeks, we have scheduled, highly structured bi-directional trainings. These trainings have become more formal, more structured, more fun. I\u2019d say approximately 50 people go onboard each month. Each person gets a score card sheet, where he\u2019ll fill it out for their training via video conference. So, in each training session, people get immediate feedback from their trainer.\n\"I\u2019ve used TED talks to set up this training. So if you\u2019ve got one video of what it\u2019s actually like in the company, and eight people watch it at a hemisphere difference location, the people that got a scorecard will see another video of exactly what it\u2019s like there. You can take any piece of feedback from anyone and their trainer, and it will give emergent lessons to all the people, not just that one in particular.\n\"People who study this at Stanford [Otterbox] have saved a lot of companies billions of dollars when it comes to communications and training. So that\u2019s very powerful. So we\u2019re constantly training on a pretty regular basis to repeat exactly what you saw when you interact with your trainer, and that\u2019s very simple push notifications, because that\u2019s how people learn these things in the 21st century.\"\n[Interviewed December 2017]\nThe breakout talk that got me connected with Hunter\nI saw Hunter's Twitter when trying to find a startup to join. After I heard that they would be flying worldwide, I saved the Airbnb pitch for my travel when COVID-19 forced me to stay home. I'd been feeling dejected lately, so nothing once the new year started seemed fun. ImageI applied for Airbnb because I saw Hunter. But I discovered a part of Airbnb I didn\u2019t know existed. If you aren't in the city, you probably face steep price differences between big cities and remote areas.

Justin Jackson scored eight of his 22 points in the second half, all during a 30-12 run spanning his 4-point play with just more than 7 minutes remaining.\nSacramento came in having completed the best home record in NBA history at 109-20 - minutes earlier than the Thunder regular-season record - is enough to held the NBA century when it comes to power-play shooting.\nThe Kings, who won the West last year, were 10 for 17, better than their record when playing at home. They could beat the Thunder in five more times this season when they host the Memphis Grizzlies on Sunday.\nStill, the Thunder looked helpless after Harden, the 2008 MVP, broke it open. He got up and put his arm on a Kings player after being fouled on a shot with 5:37 left in the first quarter.

Let\u2019s look deeply at how Novak conceives of the \u201cAmerican Catholic emergency,\u201d and more importantly, what he calls for in response to it.\nNovak believes that defeating the forces of \u201cintersectionality\u201d and a \u201cwestern secularized capitalism\u201d (pp. 30-31) is central to all the religiously based revolutions that are taking place. This view, interestingly, rests on some of the same assumptions as Ernest Becker\u2019s pessimistic diagnoses of the American religious left.

The overall sales volume for the month will make 2011 the 11th highest on record (year-to-date).

The average price in South Las Vegas was unchanged at $246,236 in February.\nAlthough 2011 paid the dividend for sales volume, as those figures were positive from January to February, that was not the case for the market as a whole or compared with the average sales price for the overall metropolitan area for that time period.

The subject presented here is illuminating first on the nature of the approach to the study of the ancient emperors, as determining how the various emperors first came to rule. Moreover, the author attempts to situate in relation to his discussion and in cultural literary terms the period he studies in the development of imperial thinking.\nThe first section of this book is concerned with what it is that the Roman empire was, as the grain which it was born at the top of the national pyramid. The second section addresses the far more problematic issue namely how the fourth-century emperors spelled out for succeeding generations what it meant to be Roman. Taking for example the writings of Augustus and subsequent comment by his successors, the author shows that the old order of infection was often challenged and it is this defection which can be read as regular seeds of later poetics that held sway in the portraiture of power which the republican writers composed. Thus there is the learned casuistry of Cicero, the humour of Tacitus, and the formal grandeur of Marcus Aurelius. Short but pungently presented, this book will interest students of past historiography as well as scholars of the period.</s><s> Is your business or plant having trouble deciding whether to hire a female supervisor? Do you need to hire a female manager but aren\u2019t sure whether you need to recruit a female or a male supervisor? This article can help you sort that out.\nIf you can achieve gender parity in your team and have even a strong balance between the genders this would be a great achievement. That means even though you have 20 senior women, you could find yourself with a 50-50 ratio of male and female employees.\nFrom a safety standpoint, junior employees tend to be assigned more female supervisors and senior employees to male supervisors. This is important, because in most industry sectors, continuity of the business is very much built into the business structure. Continuity means that additional employees won\u2019t be replacing senior employees when they move off.

But many people who encounter the flu don\u2019t know they\u2019re sick. Research published in a study published in May 2019 in TheLancet journal suggests that flu symptoms can mimic symptoms from more dangerous diseases such as Covid-19 and pneumonia.\n\u201cFlue, colds, or flu are typically self-limiting infections,\u201d said Dr. David Borges, hemorheology and microcirculatory research fellow at the Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health who studies the flu. \u201cMost people don\u2019t get sick enough to miss work or school. They go emergency and go to the hospital, but not at all because they have some type of flu virus.\u201d\nBut some people who become infected with regular flu can end up hospitalized for months, and in some cases permanently. In fact, \u201cpandemic\u201d flu was a component of more than 90% of deaths recorded in 2016 when flu strains also caused respiratory disease.\nThe new research revealed completely unrelated illnesses are commonly linked in canvassing patient symptoms paid by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. This breakdown was first looked at in a study published in July 2019 in the journal Emerging Infectious Diseases that found flu-associated pneumonia (FAP) patients died more than three times as often (15.4%), compared to people with other respiratory illnesses like the common cold and pertussis, but it was not always predictable.\nIn addition, flu-associated pneumonia patients were more likely than flu-associated meningococcal pneumonia patients to have a fever of five or greater, had constricted chest wall and blood clot, and had fatigue in addition to the most common continuing symptoms of cough, sore throat, runny nose, lack of appetite, and fever.\nThe study by Dr. Nicola Cannella, an investigator with the University of North Dakota, and CMS found that while researchers were aware of the \u201ccoincidence,\u201d many clinicians never reported it.\nC"}, {"prompt": "<s> APATZINGAN, Mexico \u2014 Federal forces struggled to bring order to western Mexico Wednesday as vigilantes battled a vicious drug cartel that apparently tried to reassert its authority by burning a downtown pharm", "gen_tokens": [4135, 304, 278, 5962, 29892, 3646, 292, 17162, 322, 5622, 4344, 29889, 13, 1349, 852, 13900, 892, 1701, 2356, 746, 278, 29871, 29953, 29900, 29900, 5144, 310, 263, 14877, 309, 1647, 2318, 15241, 385, 5337, 373, 528, 261, 2593, 30010, 29879, 20723, 583, 30010, 2594, 336, 4684, 472, 27470, 29892, 21142, 1497, 29889, 1383, 3554, 29892, 17774, 322, 16375, 21561, 892, 731, 373, 3974, 322, 2211, 4344, 892, 633, 2199, 287, 29889, 13, 1576, 4029, 29878, 928, 15134, 2996, 408, 17097, 8249, 731, 701, 1880, 29899, 11345, 26946, 453, 749, 304, 1284, 16676, 278, 6981, 333, 607, 5331, 304, 278, 1850, 287, 776, 310, 360, 11124, 6989, 12687, 3650, 18463, 262, 1346, 6489, 13741, 29877, 30024, 2088, 29920, 1171, 29892, 18451, 278, 10150, 12088, 5858, 297, 12568, 30010, 29879, 4955, 1919, 607, 1556, 13112, 723, 1833, 2440, 29889, 13, 8897, 306, 7120, 29892, 540, 338, 9963, 1048, 25757, 5342, 598, 29920, 29889, 13, 3112, 1838, 30010, 29873, 11176, 479, 1568, 515, 2400, 297, 2383, 29871, 29955, 29945, 472, 278, 9281, 297, 6225, 4101, 292, 273, 29889, 13, 12521, 276, 1953, 448, 313, 17491, 4272, 2400, 29897, 338, 4943, 409, 481, 441, 448, 338, 363, 385, 443, 262, 2616, 1971, 630, 4272, 411, 263, 8967, 4665, 2820, 29871, 29896, 29945, 29900, 29900, 2305, 322, 263, 5139, 4726, 432, 651, 411, 263, 5139, 19174, 310, 4359, 29871, 29945, 29900, 29892, 29900, 29900, 29900, 29889, 13, 18529, 11263, 860, 845, 804, 1033, 367, 10771, 297, 263, 5342, 598, 29920, 23927, 29716, 6446, 443, 12276, 287, 491, 1667, 5461, 3965, 29889, 13, 2499, 3592, 366, 750, 1023, 14368, 29892, 366, 881, 1925, 297, 278, 409, 481, 441, 310, 6225, 4101, 292, 1715, 937, 304, 2867, 445, 2246, 936, 7945, 310, 2714, 310, 372, 1641, 5342, 598, 29920, 9051, 470, 3386, 3598, 1811, 304, 2867, 372, 577, 591, 2113, 30010, 29873, 367, 2221, 304, 1303, 445, 274, 22875, 310, 263, 5828, 297, 278, 2446, 6507, 310, 278, 3965, 29889, 13, 29882, 25613, 785, 445, 10815, 3760, 457, 29920, 338, 2805, 502, 24173, 1244, 869, 869, 869, 13, 22110, 29874, 29892, 825, 526, 1906, 508, 3163, 2748, 1449, 5934, 1048, 591, 20830, 4121, 1467, 4059, 1237, 29973, 306, 2099, 306, 1854, 3282, 30010, 29873, 8293, 1048, 445, 1434, 541, 2041, 373, 372, 30010, 29879, 306, 2242, 392, 30010, 29879, 269, 11953, 1788, 29889, 13, 4591, 988, 723, 505, 1063, 1432, 7088, 263, 10322, 3700, 310, 278, 443, 29899, 4563, 272, 1133, 322, 274, 1049, 342, 457, 14576, 322, 7875, 322, 1722, 368, 6924, 11825, 310, 297, 14068, 289, 990, 6544, 4979, 3133, 5794, 8459, 304, 394, 819, 403, 1009, 3942, 5144, 29973, 13811, 1460, 3307, 540, 471, 451, 13229, 393, 12355, 267, 670, 1549, 12042, 6020, 1550, 2217, 29363, 746, 599, 491, 3654, 263, 11619, 29889, 13, 26772, 17924, 15366, 304, 8589, 4340, 2805, 8177, 310, 445, 17319, 8333, 885, 473, 479, 515, 1749, 13822, 2787, 502, 29889, 13, 3112, 769, 3512, 1346, 433, 274, 6637, 9541, 1764, 29889, 13, 29940, 2300, 1033, 451, 6219, 963], "output": "<s> APATZINGAN, Mexico \u2014 Federal forces struggled to bring order to western Mexico Wednesday as vigilantes battled a vicious drug cartel that apparently tried to reassert its authority by burning a downtown pharmacy to the ground, targeting workers and taking children.\nThose plans were foiled when the 600 members of a vigilante group launched an attack on sheriff\u2019s deputies\u2019 barracks at dawn, authorities said.

I hemmed and haweedos about how this was supposed to be a possible spammy tactic however somewhere in there I came to some sort of TLDR conclusion: their technical team put the text-only emergency button into place in the top results section at the latest in this month\u2019s update and it hasn\u2019t come down from the heights it was at.\nMy main question is, if the emergency button is used how do you \u201ctrick\u201d Google into not extending the auto-update so that your low quality content shows in normalized listings while pushing your more important things up?\nThanks for writing this down. I\u2019m in a bit of a quandry. I can see you had two keywords, paid vs. free\u2026 IE. Is it now or had it always been this way?\nhttps://www.micrositesindex.com \u2013 Google reported in 10 days. The first mobile search for that term went live in the UK on the 30th September and will be available when the updated Carlos update goes live in the USA later this year. Next month, it will also be available in Spain once the new update we talked about this month has gone live. I would assume that the USA. Google + pages will remain visible after the update goes live in the US. There will be a stage where paid and free will be available face off.</s><s> DJ Box.

The paper, which was first published in 1905 and run for many years in the Shullsburg Greene County (now Oconto) Wisconsin State Journal newspaper, was self-published by Davi. (Citing an undated newspaper still in existence, I found the ownership of the copyright.) One of the first names appeared in the following 196 hemorrhages and plains people\u2019s list below the cover of the spacious front page: somewhere in there I listed the names of all who were claimed in the hemorrhages and plains list emergency and I came in around 75 at that time in this blood storm, but have not counted later defections. Davi\u2019s horse was purchased from a Long Branch farmer, and though when Davi purchased the colt he \u201cpaid $25 for the learned horse (but) he claimed $125 for it. In the background when Davi discussed things with Lewis\u201d is shown a Long Branch pictorial, in outline shape the Red River Valley past in canvass. Includes town of Greenwood in the frame. It is now part of the Oconto Falls, Wisconsin St. Paul Daily Tribune newspaper, showing two towns of the plains. The picture doesn\u2019t have the horses names, but the writing says simply, Long Branch. Davi died in 1919, at the age of 65. Lewis Davis received a copy of the newspaper as a prize for explaining how Davi had escaped his attack. Davi and Lewis were neighbors.\nIf I find the people in the photo, I will check out the obituaries. If I find more, I will add the names. Hemorrhages are very big. Most of them were nights and drills. At the St. Paul games (1908) decided the final, as we went through over two weeks of very bad punishment that nobody knows about through many wet nights.

It's free, but is it sufficiently consumer friendly that you should switch from Windows?\nThe release version of Ubuntu 10.04 LTS is going to cost users of the popular Linux operating system nothing now that its free. But despite Ubuntu's mantra that it's for 'cool kids', unless you purchase a keyboard and mice and come with an adequate memory and CPU spec of about two gigahertz there's no way it's for 'you'.\nCanonical, the development team behind Ubuntu which has recently announced a free top-level upgrade Ubuntu 10.06 hemmed far afield from the people who choose to ignore the principle of Ubuntu being limited to a core group somewhere in china so I don't think it was in the least intended to put the system out there for big organisations to plump for, but at the latest in this series has taken that first step albeit at a base price below even the regular Android platform.\nThe main reason held for the discrepancy between the price and Ubuntu's real intent, and something which no casual reader could possibly guess, is that they've successfully engineered their system to operate on things running essentially on a specific version of the x86 desktop processor. These systems are commercially known as x86 via vertical integration, a choice of components which IEEE has as defined by 80 spec breakouts as that which's a substantial specifying market for microcomputers and calculators whereas a business computing sector doesn't need to get a processor specifying the world's memory (at release) or processor (although at its present hardware configuration can achieve up to 35GB of memory and a full 2GB of PC233 SDRAM).\nAlso unlike Android even Ubuntu is legal to run. Although Ubuntu doesn't mention the distro's real spec I suspect you could pretty much wing it anyway as the name suggests in the case of xoninned$\\P7\\winX. Most of the system seems essentially to work and run just as if it were a Windows machine but for continuity purposes the current US copy has the same x86 installation of course with Windows x64 on through Virtual Server replacing the same older installation by default.\nA small maintenance window, each element of the release having a valid date, after Clemens M\u00f8ller has been given his mandate ends on 3.

Needless to say this resulted in the design of an efficient furnace for a lime kiln. The top vent can be left open allowing air to be evacuated directly into each of the gases. Centralising the bottom vent would normally result in the need to provide a perforated tube system or chimney-like pipework to each stack face. It will be seen that these have been incorporated into most modern designs and installation of the furnace in these cases is not a continuation of the old design as per the photographs.</s><s> Tonight Andrew and I decided to take the kids to get the car seat for the christmas presents we are giving to each other.

Moreover, the case against President Nicolas Maduro is much more serious and inappropriate.\nThe charges were pretexts to justify Venezuelan dictatorship. With respect to coking, Mr. Chavez ruled that no one owned the right to coking coal at the top of the national congress. For a country in hemisphere run by a communist dictatorship, that principle is fairly spacious for some democratic institutions.\nMembers of the opposition were also condemned to death for hindering the economy by demanding the end of Venezuela\u2019s \u201csocialism\u201d in 2014 and blocking alms at churches. The verdicts against the opposition members were fake enough that there were no critical press or government programs following the trials.\nThe president, conversely, learned hard lessons from his crowdization. Mr. Chavez exacted harsh retribution on those criticizing his government, who were pilloried as completely un-Venecular and brainwashed.\nIt is not out of the question that Mr. Maduro's government thought that the outlier opposition was that flawed. The arrest on accusations of embezzlement and electoral fraud would ordinarily be the pursuit of a cemetery-aggregation in Venezuela.\nChavez\u2019s fate was guarded, but the influence of his political convictions have weakened from disproportionately supporting the once-commensurable Bolsonaro instead of seeking legal reforms. Chavez's habits distracted from real social progress in education, healthcare and regulation. Given Venezuela\u2019s higher standards, it is only appropriate that Maduro\u2019s. Most Venezuelans are unaware of Chavez\u2019s effective inefficiency because they continuously decided the leftist as an average commonsense leader.\nRegional lack of attention also brought through Maduro's anticorruption offensive. Maduro focused on the Keystone task of finishing the construction of thousands of CASA-esque panochs.

Just as humanity has never been amused that we were once extinct in the Ancient record with many species that preceded us extinct. Therefore we should gladly embrace new advancements. But it is not just that. It is more about quality in technology.\nWill people like it if they can access more health information than the one they used to have? And more importantly will they be able to remember it, as the data kept in redundancy has a limited shelf life. Will he patient be happy if I hemorrhage more easily during certain illnesses? Will the doctor make spinal operations for some persons somewhere in the world? Certainly he is talking for those having their spinal operations but the point is emergency and critical operations in hospital have many patients at any time in this globe, not just few persons.\nSome lectures will even throw regular seeds of doubt is to remember that we are in fact bringer of change which goes against \u201ctruth\u201d and there is the possibility of reversements soaring high in due course. Will this go unchallenged? Whatever things we could envisage in the future will push well beyond our ability to stay alive in the past in our imaginative world and to take the wheel in the present. It is time we thought about the life breakthroughs that take place in a flash on the other side of our constructively trying to break-in. The first mobile phone for that matter.\nIf world is gifted with the time travel machine, will that create a change and will we be ready to handle such waves. It will even create a disruption which is synonymous of holistic change. But will this be even welcome? Will we all gain sufficient respite or even find our way in the course of time when everything stops? Better should we build a bridge with technology as in the new internet age which subscribes to unlimited spaces, rather than being chained to it and drifting.

There is a definite difference between the two, however, and it has to do first with the type of impairment the child\u2019s parents are talking about (executive deficit with ADD or executive dysfunction with AD).\nIf you suspect your child is suffering from ADD or Executive Function Disorder, then it is important to get an accurate diagnosis. Many times, there are misdiagnoses (which can lead to additional behavioral problems). ADD, Executive Function Disorder, lack of motivation and ADHD are just a few of the many list of hemiblendedness symptoms people commonly misdiagnosed .\nDue diligence is necessary somewhere in order to receive the proper treatment. Talk to your child\u2019s physician and/or administrator emergency contact person to get a proper diagnosis and recommendations in order to enhance your child\u2019s success at school. Thank you Warren for sharing your experiences with this diagnostic disorder.\nAttention Deficit Hyperactive Disorder (ADHD) is very challenging to treat (but soaring remedies), because there are so many factors that go along with it. Becoming emotionally-involved in your child\u2019s overall comfort is the best way to go about preventing an inappropriate diagnosis. IEPs = Individual Education Plans? That\u2019s right! These can help you refocus on his/her needs when trying to get a diagnosis.\nLiving with that family\u2019s incredible work ethic is the most influential impact for my child when receiving an ADHD diagnosis while at school. Of course, we all have our own projects or activities that keep our minds busy; we often feel diminished for days each week without gainful respite. This habituated familial proactivity can IMPACT positively about future experiences when trying to determine where in the educational framework you need to steer your child\u2019s. Most employers accomplish an independent analysis prior to making an assessive decision in regards to job performance. Your increased sense of empowerment will be an overwhelming gift to your ADHD child \u2013 remembering that one of the many reasons why a new IEP amendment may be necessary.\nA diagnosis of ADHD can be CERTAIN, EASY to DECIDE to travel with, or unclear advise to attend.

Following up on action figure versions of the Venus de Milo and Michelangelo\u2019s David, there\u2019s now a bizarre statue made with a human face for beauty, amusement and stimulus.\nCalled the Animorph with Face, it\u2019s the work of avant-garde sculptor Julio De Caro, known for his sculptures of abstract faces with featureless skulls, bones, and other organic forms. The artist calls it \u201cart for adults.\u201d\nThis Venus statues is not the first piece of this ilk to graces Figma\u2019s hand in the last few years. You\u2019ll remember the Face Brick version, which was the first action figure of the series, or the spij De Caro released somewhere in there as well. Let\u2019s just call it \u201cCaro\u2019s Finite Artworks.\u201d\nHowever, the Human Face is not the first thing we\u2019ve seen form the hands of Caro. He\u2019s produced several faces in this regular series, but this is for the first time we find our portrait permanently etched into a \u201cfunctioning\u201d unitable -- the Face Plaster.\nA crowdful of Freaks assembles. From left, Rosamund (R0SV), Ernest (AJ002), Mathilda (D3NF), Scrutinizer (S01X), Midori (J3MR), Sidney (JF8FR) and Alexia (QGKB). Photo by David Ruderholt.\nThe Human Face is introduced in the form of a classic \u201cfigureface,\u201d a work made in the 1970\u2019s at Caro\u2019s home in Normandy, France. It\u2019s even a copy of the porcelain work of Jeanne Micallef, but it instead has applied a plastic gorilla hide inside.\nThe people holding the sculpture send out a high-pitched yowl, so as to impress every Child in the face of the un-deader.

Also, a substantial chunk of these points are layed when Baltimore is playing a team that doesn\u2019t have many downsides. Baltimore is a gifted group from quarterback Lamar Jackson to wide receiver Marquise Brown but their running backs do not possess a superstar from Christian McCaffrey to Todd Gurley Jr., instead they have a dangerous rushing offense that should be nervous. On the offensive part, the Ravens have been inspired enough that they can attend or prepare for halftime every once in a while. It will be very intriguing to see if Baltimore\u2019s game plan is going to change enough in these final eight weeks for continuity to happen.\nHowever, the Vikings may well be very relegated that additional disadvantage as well while playing the stronger opponent offensively.

It seemed to me that the first year is the ultimate training camp for any tennis player. You learn the fundamentals, all the skills, nuances. But once that year is over, the career goes wherever you go, and you\u2019re playing all year-round.\nI was self-taught, naturally. I learned by watching my own father play when I was a child. I grabbed every opportunity to watch my top-10 Roland Garros players learn better and better every year. I did the same with the highest-ranked players, spending every summers day somewhere in chilly New Canaan, Connecticut, surrounding myself with their success.\nIt doesn\u2019t emerge from the air in one day, but at KeyArena on Saturday, watching first-time players defeating top players verified this regular occurrence. In a sense, watching held players win in our sport permanently provides a new level of understanding that can set you on the way to contending for any crowd in the world. Watching became a level beyond when Federer was also playing at his stage, and maybe even more so.\nThe main reason I don\u2019t think anyone can teach you how to do anything is the same reason I love playing tennis so much. The extent of life learning can only be understood with hands-on experience. I got that lesson when I stepped onto a pro level court for the first time that very day. And it was simply the greatest moment.\nYou can watch Gates when he tries to explain the influence of his concept of \u201cComputer Next Door\u201d and what it means for the future of technology. But instead of diminishing the seriousness of his gadgetry, I find him more interesting when he\u2019s proudly discussing some of his contemporaries or the stage where he stands, as a sport subscriber. He\u2019s had conversations with coaches and teammates and openly expressed himself so in games and tournaments.\nAnd Roger Federer, as we saw today, doing the same.

In contrast to our dominance in sports, African-American men make up less than 5 percent of all males enrolled in medical school. A recent report from the Association of American Medical Colleges highlighted that nearly 92 percent of doctors, all first-generation college graduates, came from white, middle class families.\nMy determination to enter this profession shaped all aspects of who I\u2019ve become. However, I think about how much more I could have accomplished if I\u2019d started earlier if my family wasn\u2019t farm labor, there was no time to give me lessons because I was the only earning daughter, and my family couldn\u2019t afford textbooks. I think I could have made it. I think I could have farmed more intensely with less competition, gotten better at fires sped more lightning quick, fenced out more cows, and made more money than Black farmers.\nIt doesn\u2019t emerge from the fields in the manner that the old stories provide in this essay, but is instead another way of talking about African-American men\u2019s experiences with masculinity and how that affects the treatment of African-American men and their \u201cbetterment,\u201d and that needs to be contested so that the potent myths that afflict Black men\u2019s everyday lives also affect Black girls\u2019 lives.\nThe narratives that marginalized me created an unwanted past in which I had to grow up to be the same. Too often, as I drove around North LA, I overheard men talking about a history of oppression, of being put in the wrong place at the wrong time, of being treated that way. These narratives made way for a sense of impending victimhood that was unrelenting.\nThese narratives do not manifest themselves in the way many of the stories from this series do. They do not manifest themselves in the ways that I might internalize them. They manifest themselves in the way that Harper Lee\u2019s heroines internalize the men who attend or wear blackface in the everyday reality that face of the unjust spaces in which they exist.\nIn addition to drilling down on the Stetson myth (for this account continuing to embody racism) this essay looks at the very real ways that that harms Black men\u2019s performance and representation in all aspects of life.\nStephen Kinser Keen, \"Mulan Unchained: Celebrating 'Untrakable Broromeka' (Or, A Proposal for a Tremend"}, {"prompt": "<s> LAURA'S is just what Oyster Bay needs and its residents know it.

While millions of dollars could be converted into billions with Amelia on its user interface, no individual enterprise will gladly part with such investments without considerable sales upside unless AI is integrated into an end-to-end solution, experts tell ET. Amelia is a self-learning robot that is compatible with various interfaces and nuances that the human mind deals with daily. At an event yesterday, Amelia founder and CEO Carlos Ghosn said: \"AI hemispheres must be harmonious.\" Amelia will support various functions that assist women and children who don't use a voice and will serve as a neural network channel that will teach hitherto unconscious segments and connected brains. Amelia has taken another huge infection in terms of credibility with another 1700 doctors being regular revictims following is talk that held in March in Delhi. Noted digital health entrepreneur Aniruddha Ghosh said that if AI assisted by Amelia did work successfully, it could spell a revolution in things like end-stage disease managment and push wellness services. \"Amelia has the brain in can conjure up gold and diamonds of ideas in the human domain,\" he argued. Terming the out break an incremental breakout in a substantial evolution that forms part of global construct of social intelligence that's going to feed us all for that coming millennium, he further added: \"It is all about harnessing intelligence and leveraging it. If we manage it well and harness it from many corners, it synergises once the fundamental technological transformation takes place.\" As applied science is all that we have now but the concept of people knowing when to stop having ITCs is a sore spot. Holistically, in the longer term, the face of the un-chronically ill will be different. Ghosh argued that by understanding human behaviour, effective inflow of data gets repackaged \"hiding intuitive intelligence\" through algorithms. \"AI is just the front that will enhance through human touch,\" he added. There's a need for building industries, each based on another, that are able to integrate and energise different networks, Ghosh said. \"There will be travel between and symphony diagram comes in.\" Talking"}, {"prompt": "<s> MANCHESTER UNITED boss Jose Mourinho could still snare Real Madrid star Gareth Bale this summer.\nAt least that\u2019s the verdict of beIN Sports journalist Richard Keys, who", "gen_tokens": [756, 7829, 350, 744, 1033, 4682, 363, 2315, 3303, 297, 9669, 29889, 13, 30015, 29933, 744, 723, 367, 263, 12176, 3052, 363, 8198, 3201, 600, 536, 322, 1033, 9657, 403, 4958, 373, 920, 278, 4402, 4010, 267, 29889, 13, 30015, 1576, 15151, 29955, 29900, 29924, 674, 1207, 1075, 697, 310, 278, 24842, 1804, 886, 297, 3186, 5733, 297, 278, 11801, 29892, 322, 2315, 3303, 674, 3052, 2534, 4802, 29892, 7282, 10769, 763, 393, 3995, 540, 1497, 29889, 13, 15506, 338, 9436, 263, 9669, 13524, 29892, 408, 278, 10432, 3611, 338, 670, 25448, 3815, 304, 6505, 29889, 13, 15506, 10325, 7829, 8195, 9669, 881, 19417, 306, 3946, 6960, 21338, 1494, 8195, 9669, 30010, 29879, 9736, 272, 19046, 6751, 310, 7306, 17462, 414, 297, 278, 1833, 9475, 2440, 470, 577, 29892, 805, 2548, 901, 1135, 15151, 29896, 29896, 29900, 29885, 29974, 373, 25808, 273, 13675, 6491, 323, 3156, 29892, 4699, 897, 1879, 29874, 29892, 3938, 412, 830, 1099, 29892, 11176, 3460, 10322, 29899, 7864, 2496, 21739, 29892, 322, 278, 1224, 24285, 5020, 314, 1384, 29884, 678, 2620, 1324, 29872, 29889, 13, 30015, 8686, 1446, 674, 4953, 278, 716, 6056, 4943, 3307, 363, 6960, 21338, 338, 304, 505, 4934, 278, 11803, 310, 8195, 9669, 15315, 29892, 4124, 1589, 11356, 322, 13616, 1589, 11356, 29889, 13, 30015, 3421, 18988, 338, 3209, 9093, 756, 577, 4362, 23023, 1080, 2861, 304, 278, 269, 10071, 29889, 512, 1122, 29892, 746, 670, 8078, 1518, 2658, 29892, 1033, 367, 263, 1781, 14020, 304, 15649, 716, 7306, 347, 763, 5020, 314, 1384, 29884, 29889, 2, 1, 18375, 3245, 508, 29894, 2129, 750, 1023, 4799, 4972, 18196, 304, 1371, 297, 278, 3415, 22061, 362, 310, 21837, 470, 8024, 11315, 29879, 714, 310, 278, 2246, 9712, 8718, 29889, 13, 12636, 497, 2143, 1461, 706, 15252, 815, 470, 1999, 2548, 15252, 815, 869, 13, 4557, 13969, 287, 29901, 29871, 29945, 29929, 29947, 2315, 9765, 9945, 29901, 23874, 1330, 669, 3189, 29889, 13, 797, 794, 272, 9428, 9596, 1089, 472, 670, 8027, 1049, 29892, 23526, 2729, 9226, 1550, 6724, 1422, 9522, 5547, 363, 263, 301, 603, 1652, 434, 29889, 16393, 278, 8112, 508, 367, 3595, 6421, 701, 515, 1090, 484, 493, 670, 20413, 29889, 450, 8112, 338, 10959, 304, 263, 21837, 5089, 2496, 29889, 19040, 1946, 515, 263, 3536, 546, 30010, 29879, 1570, 23471, 368, 17880, 4274, 1048, 278, 1528, 10530, 365, 603, 383, 595, 815, 11444, 29892, 3971, 6339, 29871, 29906, 29929, 29892, 29871, 29896, 29947, 29947, 29946, 322, 6369, 491, 23874, 1330, 322, 3189, 29889, 25749, 29892, 17098, 29889, 13, 797, 29871, 29896, 29947, 29946, 29941, 29892, 3133, 292, 278, 3184, 361, 310, 408, 1568, 408, 540, 1033, 2599, 3654, 29892, 540, 337, 29899, 29888, 10904, 287, 278, 4933, 1549, 278, 12012, 545, 310, 278, 17285, 1506, 7358, 29892, 263, 28645, 626, 9564, 314, 362, 29892, 1269, 1543, 310, 1269, 1134, 2534, 263, 1422, 883, 29892, 322, 315, 29889, 29956, 29889, 11648, 471, 2665, 975, 304, 6985, 278, 1528, 10530, 383, 595, 815, 6938, 29889, 450, 8676, 2136, 261, 3438, 1048, 395], "output": "<s> MANCHESTER UNITED boss Jose Mourinho could still snare Real Madrid star Gareth Bale this summer.\nAt least that\u2019s the verdict of beIN Sports journalist Richard Keys, who has suggested Bale could feature for Man United in Madrid.\n\u201cBale would be a huge miss for Old Trafford and could dictate terms on how the club behaves.\n\u201cThe \u00a370M will make him one of the biggest signings in world football in the summer, and Man United will miss having big, significant players like that,\u201d he said.\nKeys is clearly a Madrid fan, as the Spanish title is his favorite team to watch.\nKeys recently suggested Real Madrid should sell Iker Casillas following Real Madrid\u2019s hemorrhaging of goalkeepers in the last eight years or so, spending more than \u00a3110m+ on veteran Ricardo Tello, David De Gea, Pepe Reina, emerging shot-stopper Roberto, and the versatile Upamanyu Chatterjee.\n\u201c defeats will become the new norm regular enough for Casillas is to have held the posts of Real Madrid captain, Inter keeper and Spain keeper.\n\u201cMy prediction is casillo has soaring emotions due to the sells.
